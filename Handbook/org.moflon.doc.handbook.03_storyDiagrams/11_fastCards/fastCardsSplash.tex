Congratulations, you're almost there! This is the last SDM needed before your Leitner's learning box is fully functional.

For very simple cards (i.e., words in a different language that are quite similar), it might be a bit annoying to have to answer these cards again and
again in successive partitions. Such \emph{fast} cards should somehow be marked as such and handled differently. If a fast card is correctly answered once,
it should be immediately moved to the final partition in the box. This way, the card is practiced once, and only tested once more before finally being ejected from the
box.

It makes sense for a \texttt{FastCard} to inherit from \texttt{Card}, so we'll extend the current object in our metamodel by a new \texttt{EClass} for fast cards, 
depicted below with a marker to show it behaves differently (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_fastCard}).

\end{figure}

In addition to creating a new \texttt{EClass}, we also need to extend the
existing \texttt{check} method to check for this special card type once a guess is determined to be correct. Now \texttt{check} needs to decide, based on the dynamic type\footnote{In a statically typed language like Java, every
object has a static type (determined at compile time) and a dynamic type (that can only be determined at runtime).} of \texttt{card}, if it needs to handle this special fast card. This
can be expressed in SDMs with a \emph{BindingExpression} (or just \emph{Binding})\define{Binding}. A binding can be specified for a \emph{bound} object variable
and is the final case in which an object variable can be marked as being bound.

To refresh your memory, we have already learnt that a bound object variable is either (1) assigned to \texttt{this}, (2) a parameter of the method, or (3) a
value determined in a preceding activity node. Bindings represent a fourth possibility of giving a manual binding for an object variable.

Finally, this new pattern faces a similar challenge as \texttt{grow}. A \texttt{FastCard} can't simply progress to the \texttt{next} partition. It must skip
ahead to the absolute last partition in the box. This means yet another NAC is required to determine the last partition in a \texttt{Box}.

\section{Checking a card}
\genHeader

The next method we shall model is probably the most important for our learning box. This method will be invoked when a user decides to test themselves on a card
in the learning box. They'll be able to see the \texttt{back} attribute of a card from the box, make a guess as to what's on the \texttt{face}, then 
check their answer (\Cref{fig:goal_check}). Following our rules established in \Cref{fig:membox_depiction}, if their guess was correct the card will be
\emph{promoted} to the next partition. If wrong, the card will be \emph{penalized} and returned to the first.

As you can see, checking \texttt{guess} is a simple assertion on string values. The actual movements of the card however, must be implemented as separate
patterns. \Cref{fig:patterns_check} briefly shows the intended create and destroy transformations.

Overall, this means the control flow must utilize an \emph{if/else} construct. The \texttt{guess} conditional also needs to be an \emph{attribute
constraint}\define{Attribute Constraint}, a non-structural condition that must be satisfied in order for a story pattern to match.

\section{A string representation of our learning box}
\label{sec_A string representation of our learning box}
\genHeader

In the next SDM we shall create a string representation for all the contents in a single learning box. To accomplish this, we will have to iterate through 
every card, in every partition. The concept is similar to \texttt{Partition}'s \texttt{empty} method, except we'll need to create a nested \emph{for each}
loop (\Cref{fig:goal_stringRep}). Further still, we'll need to call a helper method to accumulate the contents of each card to a single string.

\end{figure}

\vspace{1cm}

As you can see, The first loop will match all partitions, while the second matches each card. Finally, a \emph{statement node} is used to invoke the
\texttt{addToStringRep} method. In contrast to how they were used for conditional branching in \texttt{grow}, this statement node will simply invoke a
void method.

Unlike \texttt{initializeBox} however, this helper method is actually better specified as an injection so, analogously to how you implemented
\texttt{deter\-mine\-Next\-Size} for \texttt{box.grow()}, quickly edit \texttt{BoxImpl.java} by replacing the default code for \texttt{addToStringRep} with that
in \Cref{code:addToStringRep_inject_file}. You can use Eclipse's built-in auto-completion to speed up this process. Save, create the injection file, and
confirm the contents of \texttt{BoxImpl.inject}.

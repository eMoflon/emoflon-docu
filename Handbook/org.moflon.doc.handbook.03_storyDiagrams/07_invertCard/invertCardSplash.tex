\section{Inverting a card}
\genHeader

This next SDM \emph{inverts} a card by swapping its back and face values (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_invert}). This therefore ``turns a card around'' in the learning
box. This action makes sense if a user wants to try learning, for example, the definition of a word in the other (target) language. Instead of guessing the
definition of every word when presented with the term, perhaps they would like to guess the term when presented with the definition. This method doesn't need to
accept any parameters -- it'll use a bound \texttt{this} object variable.

Something new that we'll use in this SDM are \emph{assignments}\define{Assignments} to set the attributes of a \texttt{temp} object variable with \texttt{card},
then again to actually swap the \texttt{card} values. An assignment is simply an attribute constraint\footnote{Which we first encountered in \texttt{check}}
with a \texttt{`:='} operator. Though it may be slightly confusing to refer to an assignment as a constraint, if you think about it, \emph{everything} can be
considered as a constraint that must be fulfilled using different strategies.

With \texttt{invert}, a successful match is achieved not by searching as you would with a comparison (\texttt{==, >, <, \ldots}), but by \emph{performing} the
above assignment. If the assignment cannot be completed, the match is invalid. Similarly, non-context elements (set to create or destroy) can be viewed as
structural constraints that are fulfilled when the corresponding element is created or destroyed.  A constraint is therefore a unifying concept similar to
``everything is an object'' from OO, and ``everything is a model'' from metamodelling.  If you're interested in why \emph{unification} is considered cool, check
out~\cite{BEZ05}.

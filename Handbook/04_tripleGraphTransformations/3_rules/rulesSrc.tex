\section{Specifying TGG rules}
\genHeader

Now that we have declared our correspondence types in the TGG schema, we can now specify a set of \emph{TGG rules}\define{TGG rules}to describe the simultaneous
evolution of the source, correspondence and target models.

As we dicussed in Section~\ref{sec:nutshell}, a TGG rule is quite similar to a SDM story pattern -- it also follows a \emph{precondition, postcondition}
format. This means we'll need to state:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What pattern must be matched (i.e., under which conditions can a rule be applied)
  \item The objects and links to be created when the rule is applied to a match  (i.e., which object must exist upon exit)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

Note that the rules of a TGG only describe the simultaneous \emph{build-up} of each model, and do not delete or modify any existing elements. In other rules,
TGG rules are \emph{monotonic}.\define{Monotonic}This might seem surprising at first, and you might even think this is a terrible restriction. The intention is
that a TGG should only specify a consistency relation, and \emph{not} the forward and backward transformations directly, which are derived automatically. In the
end, modifcations are not necessary on this level but can, of course, be used at the right place in the generated transformation.

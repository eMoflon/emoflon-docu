\section{Specifying TGG rules}
\genHeader

After declaring our correspondence types in the TGG schema, we can now specify a set of \emph{TGG rules} to describe the simultaneous evolution of both source,
correspondence and target models.

A TGG rule is quite similar to a  SDM story pattern, also being in the (\emph{precondition, postcondition}) form. In other words, we have to state:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What pattern must be matched (i.e, under which conditions can the rule be applied)
  \item The objects and links to be created when the rule is applied to a match 
\end{itemize}

Note that the rules of a TGG only describe the simultaneous \emph{build-up} of the models and do not delete or modify any existing elements. In other rules, TGG
rules are \emph{monotonic}. This might seem surprising at first, and you might even think this is a terrible restriction. The point is that the TGG should only
specify a consistency relation and not directly the forward and backward transformations, which are derived automatically. It turns out that deletion is not necessary on this level to do this, but will of course be used at the right places in the generated transformations.

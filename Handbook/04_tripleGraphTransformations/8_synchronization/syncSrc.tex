{\bf Under Construction}

At this point you have successfully created a trio of rules that can transform a \texttt{box} (with an undetermined number of \texttt{partition}s which can
contain an unkown number of \texttt{card}s) \emph{forwards} into a single \texttt{dictionary} able to store an unlimited number of \texttt{entry} elements.
Unfortunately, there would be unavoidable data loss if you attempted transform data \emph{backwards} from \texttt{dictionary}.

Suppose you first ran the TGG on a \texttt{source.xmi} graph with five \texttt{partition}s, each containing three \texttt{Card}s. According to our
\texttt{IndexToLevel} implementation, the \texttt{card}s would be transformed as (1) three ``beginner'' entries, (2) three ``advanced'' entries, and (3)
nine ``master'' entries. If you were to now run the TGG on the generated \texttt{target} graph and inspect the output, you would have a \texttt{box} with
only three partitions of size nine, three, and three, respectively. There is no possible way to achieve the original construction of the other two partitions!

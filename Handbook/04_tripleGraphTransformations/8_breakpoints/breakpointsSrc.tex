\genHeader

1. Drag and drop for breakpoint model (extending the current protocol start)

2. establish breakpoint metamodel

3. use to control integrator via existing -- update 2. as needed (i.e., different checks)

TASKS:

\begin{itemize}
  
  \item Example: Find out when FORALLCARDSRULE is executed in place of CARDTOENTRYRULE
  
  \item Explain: if there were ever two different applicable rules, you could set up a breakpoint and then be prompted to choose which one you'd like to use.
  Useful for testing?

\end{itemize}

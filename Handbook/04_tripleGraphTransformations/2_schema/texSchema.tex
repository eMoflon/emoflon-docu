Need a new TGG; read MASTER THESIS HERE.

right click MOSL, new -> TGG

name it LearningBoxToDictionaryIntegration

Set the source: LearningBoxLanguage

Now it’s time to insert classes from our source and target projects into our
TGG project and declare our first correspondence type between them. The
classes Box and Dictionary are to be related to each other.

USE AUTO COMPLETION : build an INTEGRATION class for you; can press tab to jump between parts that need data

clasname :: descriptive -- BoxToDictionary

source :: box
target :: dictionary

do it again

classname :: CardToEntry

source :: Card
target :: Entry

thats your TGG Correspondence Types! Woo hoo!

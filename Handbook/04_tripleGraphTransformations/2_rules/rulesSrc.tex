\section{Specifying TGG rules}
\genHeader

After declaring our correspondence types in the TGG schema, we can now specify a set of \emph{TGG rules} to describe the simultaneous evolution of both source,
correspondence and target models.

A TGG rule is quite similar to an SDM storypattern and is also of the form (\emph{precondition, postcondition}). In other words, we have to state:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What pattern must be matched, i.e, under which conditions can the rule be applied (this is the precondition).
  \item The objects and links to be created when the rule is applied to a match (this is deduced from the postcondition).
\end{itemize}

Note that the rules of a TGG only describe the simultaneous \emph{build-up} of the models and do not delete or modify any existing elements, i.e., TGG rules
are \emph{monotonic}. This might seem surprising at first and you might think this is a terrible restriction. The point is that the TGG should only specify a
consistency relation and not directly the forward and backward transformations, which are derived automatically. It turns out that deletion is not necessary on
this level to do this, but will of course be used at the right places in the generated transformations.

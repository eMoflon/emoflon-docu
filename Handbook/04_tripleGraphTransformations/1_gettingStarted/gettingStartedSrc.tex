\section{Setting up your workspace}
\genHeader

Before you're able start any TGG transformation, you need to have two metamodels -- a source and target -- already prepared. Our source will be Leitner's
Learning Box, a partitioned container populated with cards. Each card has a keyword on its back, and a definition on its face. It is specified in
\texttt{LearningBoxLanguage}, fully built and completed in Parts II and II. Conversely, our target metamodel will be a Dictionary, a single container object
able to hold an unlimited number of entries. The goal is to have one dictionary per topic, where each entry would have a main keyword, and some relevant content. 

So how do we hope to transform a learning box into a dictionary, and vice versa? The first goal, from \texttt{BoxToDictionary}, is to combine each side of the
card as a single entry's content, then insert it anywhere into a dictionary. In the other direction, we want to be able to sort a series of entires based on
their difficulty level, in addition to splitting up their content into a useful keyword or question, and answer.

If you've just joined us in the handbook, complete Section~\ref{sec:loadSourceMeta} to load the preprepared \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox} metamodel into your
workspace. If your source metamodel is ready to go, skip ahead to  either \texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiEAP}{Section 2.2 (Visual)}}
or~\texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiMOSL}{Section 2.3 (Textual)}} to import \texttt{DictionaryLanguage} into your workspace. Please note that these instructions for
properly importing the metamodel into the same project are crucial as both metamodels must be in the same project in order to properly specify an integration
with TGGs.

\subsection{Starting Fresh}
\label{sec:loadSourceMeta}
\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To get started, press the \texttt{new} button on the toolbar and navigate to ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/''
(Fig.~\ref{fig:downPartIV}).  We have created two `cheat' packages based on eMolfon's specification types --  pick the one you would prefer to use.\footnote{For
a brief discussion on the differences between the two, refer to Part I, Section I} They both contain the finished metamodel, complete with all objects,
references, and implemented SDMs as completed in the previous parts.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] After loading, if your package explorer does not look similar to ours in Fig.~\ref{fig:workingSets} with at least two distinct
nodes, select the small, downward facing arrow in the corner of the module window. Choose ``Working Sets/Top Level Elements.'' We use these to structure the
workspace in Eclipse.

\end{itemize}

At this point we recommend reading the introduction to Part II for an overview of \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox}, it's purpose and goals, and how \texttt{card}s
are moved between each \texttt{partition}. Hopefully background will help you better understand the steps in \emph{this} part, as we're continuing to build on
that idea.

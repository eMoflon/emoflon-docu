\section{Setting up your workspace}
\genHeader

Unfortunately, before you're able get started with  TGGs, you need to have your two metamodels already prepared. Our source metamodel will be
\texttt{LearningBoxLanguage}, which we built and completed in Parts II and III. We have provided the target metamodel, \texttt{Dictionarylanguage}, in the
download zip file for this part of the handbook. You'll need to properly import this metmodel into your current \texttt{.eap} file. These instructions are
crucial as \emph{both} metamodels must be in the \emph{same} file to specify an integration with TGGs.

If you have just joined us in this part and wish to get started right away with TGGs, complete Section~\ref{sec:loadSourceMeta} to load our running example. If
you've completed Part III however, skip ahead to either \texttt{Section~\ref{sec:multiEAP} (Visual)} or \texttt{Section~\ref{sec:multiMOSL} (Textual)} for
instructions on how to import the target metamodel into your workspace.

\subsection{Loading \texttt{LearningBoxLanguage}}
\label{sec:loadSourceMeta}
\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To get started, press the \texttt{new} button on the toolbar and navigate to ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/''
(Fig.~\ref{fig:downPartIV})

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \label{fig:downPartIV}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] We have created two file packages based on the eMolfon specification type you'd like to learn. Remember, with the visual
syntax, you'll be using an external modeling program to craft your metamodel diagrams, then exporting the data to Eclipse for generation. With textual, you'll
be working entirely within the Eclipse IDE, in the eMolfon perspective. 

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] If your package explorer does not look similar to ours in Fig.~\ref{fig:workingSets} with at least two distinct nodes, select the
small, downward facing arrow in the corner of the module window. Choose ``Working Sets'' as your ``Top Level Elements.'' We use these to structure the
workspace in Eclipse.

\end{figure}

The ``MyWorkingSet" node contains \texttt{Learn\-ing\-Box\-Lang\-uage}, which in turn contains all the code generated from your metamodel. The metamodel itself
is found under ``Specifications.'' The visual metamodel is a single \texttt{.eap} file, while the textual metamodel is inside an explicit project structure.

\vspace{0.5cm}

These sets are not included under same node due to being different \emph{nature}s, or project types. \texttt{Learning\-Box\-Language} is your
\emph{repository project}, the Eclipse classification of a normal Java project.\footnote{For details on the project setup, review Part I, sections 4 and 5} 

\vspace{0.5cm}

We recommend reading the overview of \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox}, it's purpose and goals, in the introduction to Part II. This will provide the
motivation for creating a TGG with a dictionary language, and may help you understand why certain attributes and links are connected.

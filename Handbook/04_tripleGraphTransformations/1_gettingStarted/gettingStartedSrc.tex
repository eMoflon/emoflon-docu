Unfortunately, before you're able to dive into TGGs, you need to have your two metamodels already prepared. Our source graph for this example will be
\texttt{LearningBoxLanguage}, the metamodel we have built over the past four parts of this handbook. We provide the target metamodel,
\texttt{Dictionarylanguage}, as an import to your current project. These instructions are cruical as \emph{both} metamodels must be in the \emph{same} EAP
file so we can specify an integration with TGGs.

If you have skipped over the previous parts of the handbook but wish to get started right away with TGGs, we have created a small download package of
LetinersLearningBox based on the concrete specification - visual or textual - that you'd like to learn.  If you're continuing from Part III, feel free to skip
ahead to \texttt{Section~\ref{sec:multiEAP}}.

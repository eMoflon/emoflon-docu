% Eclipse import instructions; all unconfirmed.

In your current project, right-click and navigate to ``Import\ldots''

Select \texttt{File System} as the import source, and press \texttt{Next >}.

Guide your \texttt{From Directory} apth to the same folder you extraced the contents of the Part 4 download to. We've included the MOSL files for your target
\texttt{Dictionary Language} metamodel there. Be sure to confirm the \texttt{To Directory} path, and make sure it will be included in your \texttt{MOSL}
workspace folder.

Go to ``Build (Without Cleaning)'' and build your project. Two new folders -- -- should have appeared. They will contain all the generated code for these
metamodels. If you haven't already, we invite you to read Part I, Section 4.2 for details on how your metamodel and generated java code are releated.

That's it! You're now ready to get started with TGGs!

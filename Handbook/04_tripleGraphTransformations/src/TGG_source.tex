% Setting up (or starting fresh)
\input{../1_gettingStarted/gettingStartedSrc}

% Declares ONE correspondence type: BoxToDictionary
\input{../2_schema/schemaSrc}

% Develops BoxToDictionaryRule, CardToEntryRule, Builds (three repo projects), then explains the custom attribute constraint
\input{../3_rules/rulesSrc}

% Should run successfully on exclusively THREE partitions in BOX; creates one instance, runs it, renames it, ta daa
\input{../4_inAction/actionSrc}

% Introduce the 'problem' :: create a box with FOUR partitions : oh no it fails! (Explain why it didn't even partially work, it just failed the whole thing)
% Now, even if we created a model (fig) to take care of that fourth partition, there will always be a plus one that we need to deal with. So lets create one
% more rule to deal with this (in the next section we'll learn about protocols)
\input{../5_extending/extendingSrc}

% Protocols : shows the order of potential solutions, etc etc. -- MAY NOT NEED.
% \input{../6_protocol/protocolSrc}

% To deal with data loss: i.e., from partition to entry and back : no way to put say, fourth partition BACK in fourth
\input{../7_synchronization/syncSrc}

% new interface; explain how it works and then introduce breakpoints

Fantastic work -- you've mastered Part IV of the eMoflon handbook! You've learnt the key points about Triple Graph Grammars and \emph{bidirectional}
transformations, how to set up the TGG triple via a schema and created a set of rules. The transformation was visually inspected using eMoflon's integrator,
(and kept in synch via..). Knowing these basic skills should help you quickly start any metamodel transformation project.

If you enjoyed working through this part, try completing the final piece of this handbook, Part V: Model-to-Text transformations. There, we shall implement some
\emph{unidirectional} model transformations using TGGs. Alternatively, if you don't have much time left, skip ahead to Part VI: Miscellaneous for information
about some additional eMoflon features, some tips and tricks on using eMoflon efficiently, as well as an expanded glossary and list of all eMoflon hotkeys.

For detailed descriptions on the upcoming and previous parts of this handbook, please refer to Part 0, which can be found at \dlPartZero.

Cheers!

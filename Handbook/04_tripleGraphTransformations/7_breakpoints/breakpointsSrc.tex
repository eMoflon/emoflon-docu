{\bf Under Construction}

\vspace{0.5cm}

TASKS:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Streamline the breakpoint process (so user does not have to implement code re: original instructions)
  
  \item Example: Find out when FORALLCARDSRULE is executed in place of CARDTOENTRYRULE
  
  \item Explain: if there were ever two different applicable rules, you could set up a breakpoint and then be prompted to choose which one you'd like to use.
  Useful for testing?

\end{itemize}

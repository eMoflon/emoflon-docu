Lets correct this via.. using your smarts, build the \texttt{AllCardsRule} as depicted below. Think - is it possible to Dervie any of this?
doesn't matter if you add more entries: you HAVE to give them a level which wil l fall between zero and two.
So, create an extra partition in target.xmi.BWD.xmi (siurce)

When the \texttt{BoxToDictionary} doesn't work, this comes into play. It find the starter position then matches to a partition, n. You can see from the
constraint that the index for the additional partition adds 1 to n, so that the newest partition becomes n+1. Remember, the black are things that are already
established. The green indicates that there is no object like that currently in the transformation.

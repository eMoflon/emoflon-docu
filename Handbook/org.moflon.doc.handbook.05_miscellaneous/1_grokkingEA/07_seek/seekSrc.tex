\section{Seek, and ye shall find \ldots}

EA has a model search function that can be quite handy for large models with thousands of elements and a brain that can't \emph{quite} remember where something
is.

\begin{stepbystep}

\item Select \texttt{Model Search Window} in the toolbar and enter the name of an element you wish to find
(\Cref{fig_search01}).\footnote{You can also access this window by pressing
\shortcut{Ctrl+Alt+A}}

\item All elements that meet the search criteria are listed and you can right-click on each of the items and select one of the options
above to locate the element.

\item In a similar way, you can locate the corresponding class of an object by right clicking and selecting ``Find/Locate Classifier in
Project Browser.''

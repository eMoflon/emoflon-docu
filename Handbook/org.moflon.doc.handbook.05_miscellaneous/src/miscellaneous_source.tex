Welcome to the miscellaneous part of our eMoflon handbook. You can consider this
Part to be the `bonus' or appendix area of the entire handbook series. Here we have collected and documented a series of advanced topics related to our tool. These include some tips and tricks you may find helpful while using the tool with
Enterprise Architect (EA) and information about the protocol file generated with every
Triple Graph Grammar (TGG) transformation which we were never able to explain in Parts IV or V. This entire part is kept rather compact, intended to be used
mainly as a reference and consulted on demand.

Please note that if you're looking for instructions on how to properly export and import separate metamodels into the same project for work with TGG
transformations, please refer to Part IV, Section 2.2, where we included detailed steps in the context of
an example.

If you feel anything is missing from this part, or if you have any other comments or suggestions about the handbook series and our tool, feel free to contact us
anytime at \eMoflonContact.

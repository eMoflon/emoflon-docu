Welcome to the miscellaneous part of our eMoflon handbook.
You can consider this part to be the \enquote{bonus} or appendix area of the entire handbook. 
Here we have collected and documented a series of advanced topics related to our tool.
These include some tips and tricks you may find helpful while using the tool with Enterprise Architect (EA) and information about the protocol file generated with every Triple Graph Grammar (TGG) transformation which we were never able to explain in the previous parts.
This entire part is kept rather compact, intended to be used mainly as a reference and consulted on demand.

If you feel anything is missing from this part, or if you have any other comments or suggestions about the handbook series and our tool, feel free to contact us anytime at \eMoflonContact.

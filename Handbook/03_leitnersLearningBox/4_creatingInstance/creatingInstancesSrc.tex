\section{Creating Instances}
\hypertarget{creatingInstance common}{}

Before diving into modelling dynamic behaviour in Part III, let's have a brief look at how to create a concrete \emph{instance model} of your metamodel
in Eclipse.

In the following section, we use \emph{metamodel} and \emph{instance model} to differentiate between models that represent the abstract syntax and static
semantics of a domain specific language (metamodel), and those that are expressed \emph{in} such a language (instance models of the metamodel).

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To create an instance model, navigate to the generated \texttt{model} folder in your \texttt{LearningBoxLanguage} project.
Double-click the \texttt{LearningBoxLa\-nguage.ecore} model to invoke  the \emph{Ecore model editor}. The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) provides a generic
tree-model editor which allows us to create and edit an arbitrary instance of any metamodel specified with eMoflon. Expand this tree to view the different
classes and packages you've modelled.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To create a concrete instance of the metamodel, you must select a class that will become the root element of the new instance.
For our example, right-click the class \texttt{Box} and navigate to ``Create Dynamic Instance'' from the context-menu, as depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:context_menu}.

	\label{fig:context_menu}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] A dialogue should appear asking where the instance model file should be persisted. We suggest saving all your instances in a folder
named ``instances,'' which is automatically created in every new repository project. This however, is just a convention. You are free to store your
instances anywhere. Last but not least, enter a name for the instance model (Fig.~\ref{fig:store_dynamic_instance}).

  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{eclipse_boxDynamicModel}
	\caption{Dialogue for creating a dynamic model instance}
	\label{fig:store_dynamic_instance}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Press \texttt{Finish}, and the generic model editor should open for your new instance model. This editor works just like the
previous Ecore model editor except it's ``generic,'' meaning it allows you to create and edit an instance of \emph{any} metamodel, not those using Ecore.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] You can populate your instance model by adding new children or siblings via a right-click on an element of the instance model to
invoke the context-menu depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:create_instance}. Note that EMF supports you by respecting your metamodel, and reducing the choice of
available elements to valid types only\footnote{This depends on the current context. Try it out!}.

	\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{adjustModel}
	\caption{Context menu for creating model elements}
	\label{fig:create_instance}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] You can save your model as an XMI file by pressing \texttt{Ctrl+S}. The model can be reloaded via a simple double-click to invoke
the generic model editor.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Let's try building a vocabulary set. Fill your box with two partitions, with three cards in each. Your ecore tree should now
resemble Fig.~\ref{fig:eclipse_populatedTree}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{eclipse_populatedTree}
	\caption{Our Learning box with two filled partitions}
	\label{fig:eclipse_populatedTree}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Double click on one of the partitions to bring up the ``Properties'' tab in the window below the editor
(Fig.~\ref{fig:properties_partition}). Here you'll see the attributes you defined earlier in the classes. Pick a number - any one you like - and update the
\texttt{Index} value. As soon as you hit \texttt{Enter}, you'll see that the change in name has been reflected in the tree. Give the second partition a unique
EInt value as well.

	\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{eclipse_propertiesPartition}
	\caption{Change the \texttt{Index} value in the partition's property tab}
	\label{fig:properties_partition}
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] In the same fashion, double click on each \texttt{Card} you created and modify their values. In particular, modify the
\texttt{Back} attribute. Change it to `Guten Morgen.' This is the value you'll see from the partition. You'll be experimenting with the \texttt{Front} attribute
in a later, so provide a `Good Morning'value for that as well.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Fill in the rest of the cards with similar vocabulary-style words. You now have a unique, customized learning box! Ensure no errors
exist before proceeding with the final sections of this handbook.

\end{itemize}

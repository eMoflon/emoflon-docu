At this point, you should now have a small instance model completely built. While Eclipse's built-in editor offers a nice tree structure to view your model,
wouldn't it be nice to see visual depiction of your customized model? eMoflon offers a ``Graph View'' to do exactly that! You'll find that this is an effective
feature to view how each element in your actual instance model interacts with one another, and for viewing how each of your defined types are permitted to connect.

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] When you first opened the eMoflon perspective, a small window to the right should have appeared with two tabs, ``Outline'' and
``Graph View.'' \footnote{If this window is not open, you can re-activate it by right-clicking on the ``eMoflon'' button on the main toolbar and pressing
``Reset,'' or by going to ``Window/Show View/Other..,'' then ``Other/Graph View''} 

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Activate the second tab and drag one of your \texttt{Partition} instances into the empty window. 

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Here you can see your model, fully expanded to display every element it contains, connected by a named reference line
(Fig.~\ref{fig:graphView_init}).

\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Clicking any item in the view will highlight it, and hovering over a node will quickly list all its properties. If you hover
over a card, for example, you should be able to see their \texttt{back} and \texttt{face} values. You can also drag elements to new positions.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Try dragging the second \texttt{Partition} element from the model to the viewer. As you can see, it doesn't replace the current
view, it simply places them side-by-side. To clear the screen, click the upside-down triangle in the top right corner of the window, and select ``Clear View''
(Fig.~\ref{fig:graphView_init}).

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To make the graph bigger, increase the size of the window, then select ``Redraw Graph'' from the same upside-down arrow. As you can
see, when an instance is already loaded, the graph view is not automatically updated. This option is useful if you change a property of an element (ie., the
\texttt{back} value of a \texttt{Card}) and wish to see it reflected in the graph.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Try experimenting with each of the different instance elements, viewer layouts and zoom settings found under the arrow. You'll
notice for the ``Spring Layout'' that each time you press ``Redraw Graph,'' the graph will re-arrange itself, even if you haven't updated any values or changed the window size.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] The ``Graph View'' features is not exclusively for instance models; Expand the second platform in the ecore editor, and drag and
drop the \texttt{LearningBoxLanguage} package into the viewer. Your entire metamodel is now completely displayed in the viewer
(Fig.~\ref{fig:graphView_typeGraph}). We have found that the ``Radial Layout'' works best for a view of this complexity.

\subsection{ The MOSL Builder (Textual)}

\hypertarget{validation tex}{}If you make an error during your writing process, it won't show up automaticall, but it \emph{will} appear when you choose to build! The MOSL builder has validation checks built-in and will provide you with an informative message should something go wrong. Lets generate an error or two so you can see how it works.

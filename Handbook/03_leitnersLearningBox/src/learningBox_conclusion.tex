\section{Conclusion and Next Steps}

\hypertarget{conclusion}{Great job!} You finished Part II! This part was a key skill for eMoflon, as we learned how to create our static models using either syntax! They are each complete with all the required classes, attributes, references, and methods we need for a working Leitner Box.

We would like to now introduce you to the \texttt{Leitner Box Gui}, a small java application that is generated from your code! Within it, you'll be able to view the unique instances you created in Section 3. Go to the top left of your toolbar and select ``New.''

Open ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/Leitner Box GUI.'' This will load a new project into your workspace. Right click it to bring up the contex menu, and select ``Run as/Java application.'' Direct the program to open the \texttt{Box.xmi} file you saved in your workspace \texttt{instances} folder and view your work! Keep experimenting in .ecore editor by adding, removing, or renaming more attributes, and observe how they're reflected in the GUI.

If you enjoyed this section and wish to develop and implement the methods we just declared, carry on to Part III, Story Diagrams! Don't worry if you've added or removed too many things in the .ecore model. If you want to start fresh, we provide a download to help you jump right in. Otherwise, all the code you just wrote should work perfectly.

Of course, you're always free to pick another handbook if you feel like skipping ahead, and checking out some of the other features eMolfon has to offer. Check out Triple Graph Transformations (TGGs)  in Part IV, or Model-to-Text Transformations in Part V. We'll provide instructions on how to easily download all the required resources so you can start without having to complete any of the previous sections. 

For a more detailed description of each part, refer to Part 0.

Cheers!

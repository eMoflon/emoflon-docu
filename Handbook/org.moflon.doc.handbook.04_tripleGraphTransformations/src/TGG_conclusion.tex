Fantastic work -- you've mastered Part IV of the eMoflon handbook! You've learnt the key points of Triple Graph Grammars and \emph{bidirectional}
transformations, how to set up a TGG via a schema and a set of rules. The transformation was visually inspected using eMoflon's integrator. With these basic
skills, you should be able to tackle most bidirectional transformations using TGGs.

If you enjoyed working through this part, try completing the next part of this handbook, Part V: Model-to-Text Transformations. There, we shall implement a
larger transformation as a case study using TGGs. Alternatively, if you don't have much time left, skip ahead to Part VI: Miscellaneous for information about
some additional eMoflon features, some tips and tricks on using eMoflon efficiently, as well as an expanded glossary and list of all eMoflon hotkeys.

For detailed descriptions on the upcoming and previous parts of this handbook, please refer to Part 0, which can be found at \dlPartZero.

Cheers!

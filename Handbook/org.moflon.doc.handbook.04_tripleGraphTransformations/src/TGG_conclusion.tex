Absolutely amazing work -- you've mastered Part IV of the eMoflon handbook! You've learnt the key points of Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) and \emph{bidirectional} transformations, and now know how to set up a TGG consisting of a schema and a set of rules. 
With these basic skills, you should be able to tackle quite a few bidirectional transformations using TGGs.

For detailed descriptions on the upcoming and previous parts of this handbook, please refer to~\cref{sec:HandbookStructure}.
Cheers!

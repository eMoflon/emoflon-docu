\subsection{Starting Fresh}
\label{sec:loadSourceMeta}
\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To get started in Eclipse, press the \texttt{Install, configure and deploy Moflon} button and navigate to ``Install Workspace''. Choose ``Handbook Example (Part 4)''. It contains the full \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox} metamodel, as well as each method implemented as an SDM and an example instance in ``LearningBoxLanguage/instances/''.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] After loading, if your workspace does not resemble ours in Fig.~\ref{eclipse:workingSets}, with eMoflon's ``Build'' icon on the
tooolbar and a package explorer with at least two distinct nodes, first switch to the eMoflon perspective by navigating to ``Window/Open
Perspective/Other\ldots'' and choosing ``eMoflon'' from the list. Then, select the small downward-facing arrow in the upper right corner of the package
explorer. ``Top Level Elements/Working Sets.'' To review how these nodes are used to structure our workspace in Eclipse, check out Part I, Section 4.

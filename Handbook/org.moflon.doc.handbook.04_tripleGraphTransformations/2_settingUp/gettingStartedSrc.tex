\chapter{Setting up your workspace}
\genHeader

To start any TGG transformation, you need to have source and target metamodels. 
Our example will use the \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox} metamodel (as completed in Parts II and III) as the transformation's source, and a new \texttt{DictionaryLanguage} metamodel as its target.

Even if you've worked through the previous parts of this handbook, we still recommend that you start with a fresh workspace (and even a fresh Eclipse if possible). 
If you insist on keeping your stuff from the previous parts then ok---but you're on your own, and anything can go wrong.

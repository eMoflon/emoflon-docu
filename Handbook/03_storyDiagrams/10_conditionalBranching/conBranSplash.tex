\section{Conditional Branching}

\footnotetext{\bf See page xvii of the old handbook for original. This is all new.}

When working with SDMs, you'll often find yourself needing to decide which statement(s) to execute based on the return value of an arbitrary (black box)
operation. In our example so far, we have implemented these constructs via SDM \emph{pattern matching}. 

With eMoflon however, there is an alternate way to
construct these black boxes. In fact, this feature is yet another way of integrating handwritten java code with your SDM! The only ``rule'' of this feature is that your
method must return \texttt{EBoolean}, \texttt{Success}, or \texttt{Failure}, respectively corresponding to \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}. Any other values
will set \texttt{Failure} to \texttt{null}. It follows that void methods cannot be used for branching - an exception will be thrown during execution.

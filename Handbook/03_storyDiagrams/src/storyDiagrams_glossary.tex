\begin{description}

\item[\bf Activity]
A story diagram structure for one method.

\item[\bf Activity Edge]
Connect elements such as activity and stop nodes within an \emph{activity} as a part of control flow.

\item[\bf Activity Node]
Describe and contain actions that manipulate the states of objects; Defined within method implementations.

\item[\bf Assignments]
Used in context to set attributes; It's an attribute constraint specified by \texttt{:=}

\item[\bf Assertion]
\texttt{==, >, <, \ldots}; Comparisons that return a true/false value.

\item[\bf Attribute Constraint]
A non-structural contraint that must be satisfied for a story pattern to match.

\item[\bf Bindings]
Can be specified for a bound object variable, and represents the final case where the object can be marked as being bound; Represent the fourth 
possibility of giving manual bindings for an object variable.

\item[\bf Binding operator]
Definition

\item[\bf Binding State]
Definition 

\item[\bf Binding Semantics]
Definition

\item[\bf Bound vs Unbound]
Bound variables are completley determined by the current context, whereas unbound variable matches have yet to be determined by the \emph{pattern matcher}.

\item[\bf Dangling Edges]
Definition

\item[\bf Drag \& Drop (Visual)]
Definition

\item[\bf Edge Guards (Visual)]
Definition

\item[\bf \emph{For each} Story Node]
Performs the specified action for every match of its story pattern.

\item[\bf Guard Type (Visual)]
Definition

\item[\bf Link Variable]
Definition 

\item[\bf Literal Expression]
Used to specify arbitrary text, although it should really only be used for literals.

\item[\bf MethodCallExpression]
Helper function to call a method defined in another class of your current Enterprise Architect Project.

\item[\bf Negative Application Condition (NACs)]
Represent a negative element that should not be present in any valid match.

\item[\bf Object Variable]
Place holders for actual objects in the current model.

\item[\bf ObjectVariableExpression]
Refer to other object variables from preceding story nodes.

\item[\bf Parameter Expression (Visual)]
Used to refer to one of the parameters in the current method.

\item[\bf Pattern Matching]
Process in which actual objects in the current model are assigned to the object variables in the pattern according to the indicated type.

\item[\bf Statement Nodes]
Used to invoke a method from a class in any package within the current Enterprise Architect Project via a \emph{MethodCallExpression}. Guarantees method
invocation and execution.

\item[\bf Story Node]
\emph{Activity node}s that are able to contain \emph{story pattern}s.

\item[\bf Story Pattern]
A single graph transformation embedded in an \emph{activity node}.

\item[\bf Unification]

\begin{description}

\item[\bf Activity]
Container elements that describe the behavior and structure for one method.

\item[\bf Activity Edge]
A directed connection between elements (such as activity and stop nodes) within an \emph{activity} as a part of control flow.

\item[\bf Activity Node]
Describe and contain actions that manipulate the states of objects; Defined within method implementations.

\item[\bf Assignments]
Used in context to set attributes; An attribute constraint specified by \texttt{:=}.

\item[\bf Attribute Constraint]
A non-structural contraint that must be satisfied for a story pattern to match.

\item[\bf Binding (state)]
Can be set for an object variable, and represents the final case where the object can be marked as being \emph{bound}; Represent the fourth 
possibility of giving manual bindings for an object variable.

\item[\bf Binding operator]
Every object or \emph{link variable} can be set to \texttt{Check Only, Create, Destroy.}

\item[\bf Binding Semantics]
Used to create appropriate \emph{NAC}s or objects.

\item[\bf Bound vs Unbound]
Bound variables are completley determined by the current context, whereas unbound (free) variable matches have yet to be determined by the \emph{pattern matcher}.

\item[\bf Dangling Edges]
Edges that would not have either an target or source after use. They immediately make graphs invalid.

\item[\bf EA]
Enterprise Architect; The Visual modeling program used with our tool.

\item[\bf Edge Guards]
Define an if/else construct or another condition that must be satisfied before the process can reach the target node;

\item[\bf \emph{For each} Story Node]
Performs the specified action for every match of its story pattern.

\item[\bf Link Variable]
Act as unbound placeholders in a pattern; \emph{Binding operators} can be used to determine their purpose.

\item[\bf Literal Expression]
Can express any arbitrary text, though an effort should be made to use only for constants (literals).

\item[\bf MethodCallExpression]
Helper method that calls another method defined in a different class of your current \emph{EA} Project.

\item[\bf NAC]
Negative Application Condition; Represents a negative element that should not be present in any valid match.

\item[\bf Object Variable]
Free place holders for actual objects in the current model.

\item[\bf ObjectVariableExpression]
Refer to other object variables from preceding story nodes.

\item[\bf Parameter Expression]
Used to refer to the passed in method parameter.

\item[\bf Pattern Matching]
A rule applied to objects in a model (a typed graph) by finding an occurrence (a match). 

\item[\bf Statement Nodes]
Used to invoke a method from a class in any package within the current Enterprise Architect Project via a \emph{MethodCallExpression}. Guarantees method
invocation and execution.

\item[\bf Story Node]
\emph{Activity node}s that are able to contain \emph{story pattern}s.

\item[\bf Story Pattern]
A single graph transformation embedded in an \emph{activity node}.

\item[\bf Unification]
% As copied from Part II
An extension of the Object Oriented ``Everything is a object'' principle, where everything is classified as a \emph{model}, even the metamodel which defines
other models.

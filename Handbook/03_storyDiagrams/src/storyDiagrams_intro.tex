Introduce the user to this section here.

This Part picks up from a fully constructed model; In this section we will implement our methods (includes building the correct folder spaces for them.)

This section is the largest, but shouldn't take you that long. We've just included a lot of explanations and imagages.

If you want to jump right into the section, press the new wizard button and navigate to ``Exmaples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/.'' Select the appropriate files -
visual or textual - that you'd like to import. There's no need to compile - you can start right away.

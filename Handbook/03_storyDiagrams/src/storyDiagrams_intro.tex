% Rewrite and expand!
In this part, we introduce unidirectional model transformations via programmed graph transformations using Story Driven Modeling (SDM). We will be implementing
the methods signatures declared as part of the system's static semantics. It other words, we'll be building dynamic semantics! Don't let the sheer
size of this part frighten you off - We've included deep, thorough explanations and an ample number of messages to ensure clarity. It's really not so bad.

If you're just joining us, read the remainder of this section for a brief overview of the example so far and how to download the files that will let you start right away.

% Why SDMs? Graphically, the advantage is obvious. (pictures, class diagrams, containement) textually, you can see a clear distinction between the two semantic
% types, as it separates all the actitivies into separate files, folders, and patterns.

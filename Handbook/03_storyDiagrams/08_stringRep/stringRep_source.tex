In the next SDM we shall create a string representation for all the contents in a single learning box. To accomplish this, we will have to iterate through 
every card, in every partition. This means we'll need to create an inner loop nested within an outer loop (Fig.), otherwise known as a \emph{for each} loop.
Further still, we'll need another \emph{for each} loop to add the contents of each card to the \texttt{stringRep}.

SDMs support arbitrary nesting of \emph{for each} story nodes via special guards. In \hyperlink{emptyPartition vis}{section 5.1} we used the \texttt{[end]} edge
guard to terminate a loop. Now we'll use a new guard, the \texttt{[each time]}\note{[each time]} guard, to indicate control flow that is \emph{nested} in
the \emph{for each} story node and executed for each match.

% Explain a bit better?
The first \emph{for each} loop will match all partitions, where each partition is used \texttt{[each time]} to match all the cards.  When 
all cards have been matched, the second loop \texttt{[end]}s, and returns to the outer loop.

The second \emph{for each} will need to print the contents of every card to the string. If you review your metamodel, we declared the \texttt{addToStringRep()}
method. To invoke this, we'll create another \texttt{MethodCallExpression}, similar to how we did in \hyperlink{sec:growBox}{section 5}.

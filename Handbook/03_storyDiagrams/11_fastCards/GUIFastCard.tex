\subsection{FastCards in the GUI}
\genHeader

We hope you haven't forgotten about the GUI! Now that we have a new \texttt{card} type, let's try editing our \texttt{box} instance so we can experiment with
them in our application!

\begin{itemize}
  
\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To review the details of creating instances, read Part II, Section 3 but for now, open \texttt{Box.xmi} and right-click on your
first partition and create a new \texttt{FastCard} child element. Fill in some \texttt{back} and \texttt{face} values to test (Fig.).

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Save your file, then run the \texttt{check} method on your new card. Experiment with making the wrong and correct guess, and notice
its behavior. If you've done everything right until this point, it should act differently than its standard \texttt{card} counterparts.

\end{itemize}

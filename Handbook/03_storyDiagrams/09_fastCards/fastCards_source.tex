Congratulations, you're almost there! This is the last SDM we need to build to make Leitener's Learning Box fully functional.

For very simple cards (i.e: words in different language that are similar), it might be a bit annoying to have to answer these cards again and again in every
partition. Such \emph{fast} cards should somehow be marked and handled differently! If a fast card is gotten right once, it should be immediately moved to the
last partition in the box. This way the card is reviewed once, and is tested only once more before finally being removed from the box (Fig.).

It makes sense that a \texttt{fastCard} is simply inherited from \texttt{Card}.

\section{Checking a card}

The next method we shall model is probably the most important! This method will be invoked when a user decides to test themselves on a card in the
learning box. They'll be able to see the \texttt{Back} of a card from the box, make a guess as to what's on the \texttt{Face}, then check their
answer (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_check}). Following the Leitner's Box rules, if their guess was correct the card will be \emph{promoted} to the next
partition. If wrong, the card will be \emph{penalized} and returned to the first.

As you can see, checking \texttt{guess} is simple assertion. The actual movements however, must be implemented as separate patterns.
Fig.~\ref{fig:patterns_check} briefly shows the intended constructive and destructive transformations.

Overall, this means the control flow must be an \emph{if/Else} construct. This is specified in SDM via \emph{edge guards}, \define{Edge~Guards}explicit
statements on which activity edge to follow when the \emph{if} statement fails or succeeds. To implement this, the conditional must be an \emph{attribute
constraint},\define{Attribute Constraint}a non-structural condition that must be satisfied for a story pattern to match. 

%The comparison is referred to as a \texttt{ParamterExpression}.

The next method we shall model with SDMs is probably the most important! This method will be invoked when a user decides to test themselves on a card in the
learning box. The user will be able to see the \texttt{Back} of a card (displayed in the box), make a guess as to what's on the \texttt{Face}, then check their
answer (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_check}). Following the Leitner's Box rules, if their guess was correct the card will be \emph{promoted} and moved to the next
partition. If wrong, the card will be \emph{penalized} and returned to very first partition.

As you can see, checking the guess is simple assertion. The actual movements however, must be implemented as separate patterns. Fig.~\ref{fig:patterns_check}
briefly shows the intended creation and deletion transformations that each of these patterns must execute.

Overall, this means that our method's control flow must be a new \emph{if/Else} construct. This is specified in SDM via \emph{edge guards},
\define{Edge~Guards}explicit statements on which actions to take when the \emph{if} statement fails or succeeds. To implement this, the \emph{if} statement must
include an \emph{Attribute Constraint},\define{Attribute Constraint}a non-structural condition that must be satisfied for a story pattern to match. This
special attribute type will compare the user's guess to the actual answer on the back of the card. The comparison is referred to as a \texttt{Paramter
Expression}.

Now that you have a solid foundation of SDMs, this next part should be a breeze.

\section{Extending the Leitner's Box GUI}
\genHeader

Here, user needs to edit the code to permit the GUI to access the checkCard method. Explain that the ideas in this section can easily be transited to implement
\emph{any} method implemented in this Part. We've only included one in order to keep this preview short.

open LeitnersBoxController.java from the source file. \\

scroll down to doActionCheckCard. Uncomment @TODO \\

save. Run application.\\

it works! mwuahahahaaha

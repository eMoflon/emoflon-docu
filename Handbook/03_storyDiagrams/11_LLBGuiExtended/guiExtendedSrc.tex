In addition to \texttt{removeCard}, the GUI is able to access and operate the \texttt{check} method using your SDM implementation! To avoid build errors
however, it was originally commented out so you'll need to release it. First, double check and make sure your metamodel is built, and that you have correctly
imported the GUI.\footnote{Review how to download and run the GUI in Part II, section 6}

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Go to ``Other Projects/LeitnersBox/Src'' and open \texttt{Leitners\-Box\-Cont\-roller\-.java} in the package.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] On the far right side of the editor, you should be able to see two blue rectangles in the space beside the scrollbar. Click on the
second to skip ahead to the \texttt{check} command (Fig.~\ref{fig:remComment}).

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Remove the commented line below the \texttt{TODO} statement, save the file, then take your GUI for a spin! Experiment with
making right and wrong guesses, and watch how your cards move through the box. Try editing your instance file by making more partitions, cards and some
new \texttt{FastCard}s to see how they behave.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] The next SDM \emph{inverts} a card by swapping its back and face values. This therefore ``turns the card around'' in the learning box, which makes sense when
learning, for example, a new language. You're no longer an SDM beginner, so model the SDM depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:sdm_invert}.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Believe or not, that's it! Check out how this method was implemented in the textual syntax by reviewing
Fig.~\ref{fig:invertPatterns} in the next section.

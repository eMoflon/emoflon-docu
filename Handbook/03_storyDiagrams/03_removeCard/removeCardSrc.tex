\section{Removing a card}
\hypertarget{sec:remCard}{}

Since we're just getting started with SDM's, lets re-implement the method we created via injections. we'll begin with a straightforward diagram. The goal of
this SDM is to remove a single card from its current partition (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_removeCard}), which can be done by destroying a reference between the two
items.

According to the signature of the method \texttt{removeCard}, we should return the card that has been deleted. Although this might strike you as slightly odd,
considering that we already passed in this exact card as an argument, it still makes sense as it allows for chaining method calls:
\begin{quote}\texttt{aPartition.removeCard(aCard).invert()}\end{quote}

% SDMs are placed in SDM containers, named according to the method they implement.
Since this method makes a structure change, it \emph{must} be implemented as a pattern. Lets get started by removing the code the previously injected code.

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Go to PartitionImpl.java remove everything under \texttt{removeCard(Card card)} ({\bf check})
% and replace everything under \texttt{removeCard(Card card)} with: \\
% 		// TODO: implement this method here but do not remove the injection marker 
% 		throw new UnsupportedOperationException() \\

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Delete PartitionImpl.inject from the ``injection'' folder of your working set.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Now, click somewhere in your package explorer, then go to ``Build (Without Cleaning)'' on the toolbar. It should compile without
error.

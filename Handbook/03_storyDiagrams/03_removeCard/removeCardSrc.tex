\section{Removing a card}
\hypertarget{sec:remCard}{}

Since we're just getting started with SDM's, lets re-implement the method previously created with injections.\footnote{To review how to make
injections, refer to Part II, section 6} The goal of this method is to remove a single card from its current
partition, which can be done by destroying the link between the two items (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_removeCard}).

According to the signature of the method \texttt{removeCard}, we should return the card that has been deleted. Although this might strike you as slightly odd,
considering that we already passed in the card as an argument, it still makes sense as it allows for chaining method calls:
\begin{quote}\texttt{aPartition.removeCard(aCard).invert()}\end{quote}

Before we implement this change as a pattern, lets remove the old injection content to avoid potential conflicts.

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Delete the \texttt{PartitionImpl.inject} file from your working set (Fig~\ref{fig:delete_injection}).

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Now select your ``Specifications'' node and rebuild your project by navigating to the ``Build (Without Cleaning)'' button on the
toolbar.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] You'll be able to see the change in \texttt{PartitionImpl.java}, found under ``MyWorkingSet.'' The \texttt{removeCard}
declaration should now look the same as the other declarations.

You're ready to start your first SDM! Make sure your project compiles without error before continuing.

\section{Leitner's learning box reviewed}

\emph{Leitner's learning box}\footnote{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner\_system}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner\_system}} is a simple, but
ingenious little contraption to support the tedious process of memorization, especially prominent when trying to learn, for example, a new language. As depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:membox_depiction}, this box consists of a series of partitions with a strict set of rules. The contents to be memorized are written on little cards and placed in the first container. Every
time the user correctly answers a card, that card is promoted to the next partition. Once it reaches the final partition, it can be considered memorized, and
no longer needs to be practiced. Every time the user incorrectly answers a card however, it is returned to the original starting partition, and the
learning process is restarted.

For a more detailed overview of the box and our goals, we recommend you read the introduction to Part II. But for now, enough discussion!

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To get started, press the \texttt{new} button and navigate to ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/''
(Fig.~\ref{fig:downloadWizard}).

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Choose the cheat package for Part III and the syntax you prefer (textual or visual). Read Section 1 from Part I for details on
the differences between the types.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] If your package explorer does not resemble ours in Fig.~\ref{fig:workingSets} with at least two distinct nodes, select the
small, downward facing arrow in the corner of the package explorer. Choose ``Working Sets'' as your ``Top Level Elements.'' We use these to structure the
workspace in Eclipse.

The ``MyWorkingSet" node contains \texttt{Learn\-ing\-Box\-Lang\-uage}, which in turn contains all the code generated from your metamodel. The metamodel itself
is found in \texttt{Leit\-ners\-Learn\-ing\-Box} under ``Specifications.'' The visual metamodel is a single \texttt{.eap} file, while the textual metamodel is
contained within an explicit folder structure, starting with ``/MOSL''. 

These projects are not placed in the same working set as they have different \emph{nature}s, or project types. \texttt{Learning\-Box\-Language} is a
\emph{repository project}, while \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox} is a metamodel project.

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Inspect the files in both projects until you feel comfortable with what you'll be working with. In particular, look at the files
found under ``gen." Each Java file has a corresponding \texttt{.impl} file, where all generated method implementations will be placed.\footnote{For
more details, refer to Part II, Section 5} 

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Be sure to also review the Ecore model in ``LearningBoxLanguage/model/'' and the dynamic model found in ``instances.'' While
you can make and customize your own instances,\footnote{To learn how to make your own instance models, review Part II, Section 4} we have included a small
sample to help you get started.

\end{itemize}

Well, that's it! A quick review, paired with a fine cheat package makes an excellent appetizer to SDMs. Let's get started.

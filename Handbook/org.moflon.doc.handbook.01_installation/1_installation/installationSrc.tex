{\bf \Huge Installation and Setup }

This part provides a very simple example and a JUnit test to check the installation and configuration of eMoflon. It can be considered mandatory if you are new to eMoflon, but we recommend working through it anyway.

After working through this part, you should have an installed and tested eMoflon working for a trivial example. We also explain the general workflow, the different workspaces involved.

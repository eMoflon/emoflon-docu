\begin{stepbystep}

\item  In Eclipse, choose \texttt{Working Sets} as your top level element in the package explorer (\Cref{eclipse:topLevel}), as we use them to structure the workspace.

	\caption{Top level elements in Eclipse}
	\label{eclipse:topLevel}
\end{figure}

\item 
Locate \menuPath{Other Projects \menuSep org.moflon.demo.doublelinkedlist.test}.
This is the testsuite imported with the demo files to make sure everything has been installed and set up correctly.
Right click on the project to bring up the context menu and go to \menuPath{Run As \menuSep JUnit Test}.
If anything goes wrong, try refreshing by choosing your metamodel project and pressing \entity{F5}, or right-clicking and selecting \entity{Refresh}.

Congratulations!
If you see a green bar (\Cref{eclipse:passedTest}), then everything has been set up correctly and you are now ready to start metamodeling!

\item
Open Eclipse to a clean, fresh workspace.
Go to \menuPath{Window \menuSep Open Perspective \menuSep Other\ldots} \footnote{A path given as \menuPath{foo \menuSep bar} indicates how to navigate in a series of menus and toolbars.
New definitions or concepts will be \newconcept{italicized}, and any data you're required to enter, open, or select will be given as \entity{command}.} and choose \texttt{eMoflon} (\Cref{eclipse:openPerspective}).

\item
At either the far right or center of the toolbar, a new action set should have appeared.
Navigate to \menuPath{\enquote{eMoflon Cloud} \menuSep Install Workspace} \LK{Please update the screenshot.}
(\Cref{eclipse:newMetamodel}).

\item
In this menu you can check out different workspaces for Eclipse. 
Here you can also check out workspaces for the handbook tutorials (\menuPath{eMoflon Examples}).
How you can create your own projects is described in Part I.
As the first tutorial select \menuPath{eMoflon Examples \menuSep Demo (Double-Linked List)}. 

All our handbook examples are provided via Git and are hosted on GitHub\footnote{See \url{https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-examples}.}.
If you encounter problems when fetching some handbook example, the reason may be that your checked out working copy is in a \enquote{dirty} state.
In this case, you may start over by 
\begin{inparaenum}
\item removing all affected projects from your workspace (do \emph{not} tick \menuPath{Delete project contents on disk}),
\item navigating to the \menuPath{Git} perspective in Eclipse (\menuPath{Window \menuSep Perspective \menuSep Open Perspective \menuSep Other\dots}) and
\item performing one of the following:
\end{inparaenum}
\begin{itemize}
\item The drastic solution:
Right-click your working copy \eMoflonExamplesRepo and choose \menuPath{Delete Repository...}.
Make sure to fully delete the repository by ticking all boxes.
\item The smooth solution:
Right-click your working copy \eMoflonExamplesRepo and select \menuPath{Clean\dots}.
Tick \menuPath{Clean selected untracked files and directories} and \menuPath{Include ignored resources}, and confirm with \menuPath{Finish}.
The previous command has purged all untracked and ignored files but modifications of files tracked by Git are still kept in their modified state.
To undo these changes, right-click your working \eMoflonExamplesRepo copy again and select \menuPath{Reset\dots}.
Select \menuPath{master} and tick \menuPath{Hard}, then confirm with \menuPath{Reset}.
\end{itemize}


\item
Another button in the new action set is \menuPath{View and configure logging} represented by an \texttt{L} (\Cref{eclipse:logger}).
Clicking this icon will open a \texttt{log4jConfig\-.properties} file where you can silence certain loggers, set the level of loggers, or configure other
settings.\footnote{If you're not sure how to do this, check out a short Log4j tutorial a \url{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html}} All of eMoflon's
messages appear in our console window, just below your main editor. This is automatically opened when you selected the \texttt{eMoflon} perspective and
contains important information for us if something goes wrong!

\section{Using Enterprise Architect with Subversion}
\visHeader

The following steps are required to setup EA for use with subversion. This is highly recommended when working in a group and sharing a single EA Project (EAP)
file, which is otherwise a huge binary blob. This section assumes two things - that you wish to use (i) Subversion and (ii) Windows. For other SCM
and operating systems please consult the official documentation from EA.

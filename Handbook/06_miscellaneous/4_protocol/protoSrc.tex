\section{The Transformation Protocol}

\genHeader

In Part IV, Section 6, we reviewed how to use the integrator feature to visually trace the transformation process. It's based on the correspondence metamodel,
but actually runs off the relevant \texttt{protocol.xmi}, which is a tree you are able to view directly. This file is a listing of each attempted, successful,
and failed step in the transformation process. More than that, it includes detailed notes on the object it was operating on, and instead of just indicating that
something has gone wrong, it lists the reason why. This file can be a useful debugging tool for when you're \emph{really} stuck.

To help explain, we will refer to the forward protocol file generated in Part V, when translating from the MocaTree to the dictionary model. More
specfically, we'll compare what we're able to see using the integrator as shown section 3.3, when the construction of the transformation at that time presented
a choice between two valid rules for handling authors.

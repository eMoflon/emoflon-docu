\subsection{Seek, and ye shall find \ldots}
EA has a model search function that can be quite handy for large models with thousands of elements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\blacktriangleright$]Select ``Model Search Window'' and enter the name of an element you wish to search for (Fig.~\ref{fig_search01}).
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.63\textwidth]{search1}
  \caption{Model Search Window}  
  \label{fig_search01}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] All elements that meet the search criteria are listed and you can right-click on each of the items and select ``Find in Diagrams''
or  ``Find in Project Browser'' to locate the elements.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] In a similar way, you can locate the corresponding class of an object by right clicking and selecting ``Find/Locate Classifier in
Project Browser''.
\end{enumerate}

For more flexible search functionality, see Appendix \ref{sect:appendix_adv_search}.

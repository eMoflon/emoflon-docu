\section{MOSL syntax}
\genHeader

We have decided to describe the MOSL syntax with the context-free EBNF syntax. Not only will this reference help users of the textual syntax when defining their
metamodels, this guide will be useful when writing your own ANTLR parser/unparser for any future unidirectional TGG transformation projects with
eMoflon.

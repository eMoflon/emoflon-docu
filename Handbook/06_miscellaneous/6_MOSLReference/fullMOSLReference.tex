\section{MOSL syntax}
\texHeader

Throughout the handbook series, we have described our Moflon Syntax Language (MOSL) using detailed context-free EBNF. In an effort to keep this section as a
quick-reference document and not as a teaching tool, we have summarized all in the following. Not only will this reference help remind how to define a
metamodel, it will be useful when writing your own ANTLR parser/unparser for any future unidirectional TGG transformation projects with
eMoflon.

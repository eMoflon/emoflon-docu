\section{Using existing EMF projects in eMoflon}
\visHeader

This chapter contains stepwise instructions on how to use existing \mbox{EMF}/Ecore projects with an eMoflon project specified using the visual syntax via EA.
We will present an example of an existing metamodel which must be integrated with eMoflon before, for example, its transformation using SDMs can be
specified. The basic workflow for using an existing EMF project in eMoflon is described in the following and may of course be similarly applied to a metamodel
specified in the textual syntax via MOSL. 

We will begin by implementing a small subset of the \texttt{Ecore -> GenModel} transformation, where \texttt{GenModel} is part of the EMF/Ecore standard. The
\emph{GenModel} for a given Ecore model can be viewed as a \emph{wrapper} that contains additional generation-specific Java code details. These details are
separated from the Ecore model to keep it free of such ``low-level'' information and settings.

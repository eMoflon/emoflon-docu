\section{Model To Tree with TGGs}

This is the second half of our round trip. You may have noticed after running \emph{TGGMain} in the forward direction, that the backwards transformation also
succeeded. This transformation used the \texttt{tree.xmi\_fwd.xmi} model (generated from your original text) and drove it through another transformation to
change it \emph{back} to a tree, where it will be transformed one more time by the ANTLR unparser to get back to our original text format.

Lets compare this resulting file, \texttt{tree.xmi\_FWD.xmi\_BWD.xmi}, against our original \texttt{tree.xmi} model.

You can see that some things need to be fixed up -- we're missing the ``DICTIONARY'' and ``ENTRY" headings of the major nodes. Obviously, some refinement is
needed here..

Note:: oarser requires that all attribute constraints are declared before link variables.

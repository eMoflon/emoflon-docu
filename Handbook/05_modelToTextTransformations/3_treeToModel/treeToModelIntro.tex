% Intro :: separate?  Rename source files?? (Hard to read..)

Review Part IV, Section 2: \emph{Triple Graph Grammars in a nutshell}, for a detailed and worthwhile overview on how and why TGGs are so useful. In summary,
TGGs form \emph{graph triples} consisting of separate source, correspondence, and target components. They are a declarative, rule-based techinique of specifying
the evolution of these three graphs. The correspondence component specifies links between specific elements, and can be used whenever you want to guarantee the
source and target components remain consistent in the context of the rule.

Our goal in this section is to break down the broad \texttt{MocaTree} to \texttt{Dictionary} transformation into smaller, modular steps. More specifically, we
want separate rules for transforming folders into their container elements, then rules for some of the specific file nodes.

// Figure of changing tree into dictionary? (see book)

A key idea to keep in mind is the flexibility this transformation will require. In future \texttt{tree} instances, we may not know how many subfolders
\texttt{myLibrary} will contain, whether or not each \texttt{.dictionary} file will even have an author (as seen in \texttt{unknown.dictionary}), or how many
entries each \texttt{dictionary} will contain.

\section{Tree to Model Transform with TGGs}
\genHeader

% Intro :: separate?  Rename source files?? (Hard to read..)
All new stuff! We now have a TGG between MocaTree and DictionaryLanguage : lets do the first half of the transformation: text to tree (parsed), tree to Model
(now). Later will do Model to text (unparser) 

Summary of what we'll introduce: (general, not vis vs. tex)
{\bf OPTIONS(2):} No author repeated (we create a NAC in context of TGGs\footnote{previously introduced in Part
III, Section (SDMs).} and an eMoflon feature :
refactoring (because no one wants to draw everything twice.) Don't care: have to create a configurator.)

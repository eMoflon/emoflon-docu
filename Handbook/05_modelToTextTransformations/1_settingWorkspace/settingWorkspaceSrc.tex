Nowadays, \emph{no one} really writes a complex parser completely by hand. Although this is sometimes still necessary\footnote{Some languages are syntactically
quite challenging.} most parsers can be whipped up pretty quickly using context-free \emph{string grammars}\footnote{For simple cases, \emph{regular
expressions} can also be used.} typically in EBNF\footnote{Extended Backus-Naur Form}.
ANTLR~\cite{ANTLR} is a tool that can generate a parser from a compact EBNF specification for a host of target programming languages, including Java.
Although ANTLR might not be the most efficient or powerful parser generator out there, it is open-source, well documented and supported, and allows for a
pragmatic and quite elegant \emph{fallback} to Java when things get nasty and we have to resort to some dirty tricks.

The first step is preparing an Eclipse workspace according to our suggested workflow.

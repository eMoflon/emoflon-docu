Nowadays, \emph{no one} writes a complex parser completely by hand. Although this is sometimes still necessary for syntactically challenging languages, most
parsers can be quickly whipped up using context-free \emph{string grammars}.\footnote{For simple cases, \emph{regular expressions} can also be used} These are
typically written in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)\define{EBNF}. ANTLR~\cite{ANTLR} is a tool that can generate a parser from this compact specification for
a host of target programming languages, including Java. Although ANTLR might not be the most efficient or powerful parser generator, it is open-source, well
documented and supported, and allows for a pragmatic and elegant fallback to Java when things get nasty and we have to resort to some dirty tricks to get our
job done.

A parser, of course, is based on whatever model it must work with. Given that we want to parse to and from a dictionary, we need to have the
\texttt{DictionaryLanguage} metamodel defined before starting. The dictionary is a relatively simple device, so you have three options to loading this project
into your workspace:

\begin{description}

% -- Develop Metamodel ---
\item[Option 1: Develop] You can start a new metamodel project called \texttt{Dict\-ion\-aryLanguage} (Fig.~\ref{eclipse:startMetamodel}) and complete a
\texttt{Dictionary} package. until it matches either Fig.~\ref{ea:dictLang} or Fig.~\ref{eclipse:dictLang}.\footnote{Review metamodel construction by
working through Part II: Ecore}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\newpage % ---

% -- Download Cheat Package ---
\item[Option 2: Download] You can download our cheat package and load a \texttt{Dictionary} specification into your workspace using
the Eclipse ``New" wizard (Fig.~\ref{eclipse_cheatPackage}).

  \caption{Load a \texttt{Dictionary} project into your workspace}
  \label{eclipse_cheatPackage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Depending on your syntax choice, pressing \texttt{Finish} will load the relevant files into a 
\texttt{Dictionary} project in your workspace.

\vspace{2cm}

% -- Export/Import ---
\item[Option 3: Import] You can simply use the same files for \texttt{Dictionary} as you used in Part IV. Export the specification files, then import them
into a new project in a fresh workspace. Read Part IV, Section 2 for a detailed review on how to do this in either syntax.

This metamodel is one of two that we'll be using to specify the transformation. After all, TGGs \emph{always} require a source and target graph, and this will
represent our target. If you haven't already, we recommend inspecting \texttt{DictionaryLanguage} until you feel comfortable with what you'll be working with.
Its important to understand which classes are connected.

Our second metamodel will be eMoflon's standard \texttt{MocaTree} language. It basically combines concepts from a filesystem (folders and files), XML concepts
(text-only nodes and attributes), and a general indexed containment hierarchy.\footnote{This is done with an index attribute, which can be used to demand a
certain \emph{order} of nodes in an SDM which are otherwise not guaranteed by default.} It models a generic directory structure with a \texttt{Folder} able to
connect to other \texttt{Folders}, and may contain an unlimited number of \texttt{File} elements. Its Java code is provided by the Eclipse plugin and
automatically added to the build path.  We'll go into more detail about this later, so let's begin the next task: initialize the TGG project that will drive our
model-to-text transformation.

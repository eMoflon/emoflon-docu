\section{Setting up the workspace}
\genHeader

Nowadays, \emph{no one} writes a complex parser completely by hand. Although this is sometimes still necessary for syntactically challenging languages, most
parsers can be quickly whipped up using context-free \emph{string grammars}.\footnote{For simple cases, \emph{regular expressions} can also be used} These are
typically written in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)\define{EBNF}. ANTLR~\cite{ANTLR} is a tool that can generate a parser from this compact specification for
a host of target programming languages, including Java. Although ANTLR might not be the most efficient or powerful parser generator, it is open-source, well
documented and supported, and allows for a pragmatic and elegant fallback to Java when things get nasty and we have to resort to some dirty tricks to get our
job done.

A parser, of course, is based on whatever model it must work with. Given that we want to parse to and from a dictionary, we need to have the
\texttt{DictionaryLanguage} metamodel defined before starting. The dictionary is a relatively simple device, so you have three options to loading this project
into your workspace:

\begin{description}

% -- Develop Metamodel ---
\item[Option 1: Develop] Start a new metamodel project called \texttt{Dict\-ion\-ary} (Fig.~\ref{eclipse:startMetamodel}) and complete a
\texttt{DictionaryLanguage} package until it matches either Fig.~\ref{ea:dictLang} (Visual), or Figs.~\ref{eclipse:dictLang} \&
\ref{eclipse:dictLangMetamodel} (Textual).\footnote{Review metamodel construction by working through Part II: Ecore}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\newpage % ---

% -- Download Cheat Package ---
\item[Option 2: Download] You can download our cheat package and load the \texttt{Dictionary} specification of your choice into your workspace using
the Eclipse ``New" wizard (Fig.~\ref{eclipse_cheatPackage}).

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{eclipse_loadDictionaryProject}
  \caption{Load a \texttt{Dictionary} project into your workspace}
  \label{eclipse_cheatPackage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\vspace{2cm}

% -- Export/Import ---
\item[Option 3: Import] You can simply use the same files for \texttt{Dictionary} as you used in Part IV. Export the specification files, then import them
into a new project in a fresh workspace. Read Part IV, Section 2 for a detailed review on how to do this in either syntax.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Please note that, despite our efforts to ensure uniformity between each of the options, your workspace may look different than ours depicted in the
screenshots. As long as you have the correct and non-conflicting files however, the steps are identical.

\end{description} 
% -- End

This \texttt{dictionaryLanguage} metamodel is one of two that we'll be using to specify the TGG transformation. After all, TGGs \emph{always} require separate
source and target metamodels. If you haven't already, we recommend inspecting the files until you feel comfortable with what you'll be
working with. Its important to understand which classes are connected.

The second metamodel involved in the transformation will be eMoflon's standard \texttt{MocaTree} language. It basically combines concepts from a filesystem
(folders and files), XML concepts (text-only nodes and attributes), and a general indexed containment hierarchy.\footnote{This is done with an index attribute,
which can be used to demand a certain \emph{order} of nodes in an SDM which are otherwise not guaranteed by default.} It models a generic directory structure
with a \texttt{Folder} able to connect to other \texttt{Folders}, and may contain an unlimited number of \texttt{File} elements. Its Java code is provided by
the Eclipse plugin and automatically added to the build path, so it won't actually appear anywhere in your workspace.  We'll go into more detail about this
later, so let's begin the next task: initializing the TGG project that will drive our model-to-text transformation.

\section{Setting up your workspace}
\genHeader

Nowadays, \emph{no one} writes a complex parser completely by hand. Although this is sometimes still necessary for syntactically challenging languages, most
parsers can be quickly whipped up using context-free \emph{string grammars}\footnote{For simple cases, \emph{regular expressions} can also be used} that are
typically written in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)\define{EBNF}. ANTLR~\cite{ANTLR} is a tool that can generate a parser from this compact specification for
a host of target programming languages, including Java. Although ANTLR might not be the most efficient or powerful parser generator, it's open-source, well
documented and supported, and allows for a pragmatic and elegant fallback to Java if things get nasty and we have to resort to some dirty tricks to get the job
done.

To set up your workspace for the model-to-text transformation, you have two options: (1) Import a cheat package with everything already
prepared,\footnote{Useful if you're just joining us in this part} or (2) continue working with your existing workspace if you've worked through the previous
part.

Both options will work, but note that all of our screenshots from now on assume that you chose Option (1), so don't let that irritate you.

As some of you are just reading this handbook without actually getting your hands dirty with an implementation (beware: no pain, no gain!), we have included a
screenshot of the dictionary metamodel that you get with both options in our visual (Fig.~\ref{ea:dictLang}) and textual (Fig.~\ref{eclipse:dictLangMetamodel})

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] \hspace{0.3cm} Import the Part V `cheat package' by selecting ``New" in the toolbar, and the cheat package in the concrete syntax
of your choice (Fig.~\ref{eclipse_cheatPackage}).

\item[Option 2: Continue with the workspace from Part IV]


\item[$\blacktriangleright$] \hspace{0.3cm} Use the same metamodel for \texttt{Dictionary} as completed in Part IV. Just make sure you haven't radically changed
the dictionary metamodel (i.e., it still closely resembles the metamodel in either Fig.~\ref{ea:dictLang} or Fig.~\ref{eclipse:dictLangMetamodel}). Everything
else should work fine using the exact same workspace but remember, your screen may look different than our screenshots.

\end{description}


We recommend reviewing the dictionary metamodel until you feel comfortable with what you'll be working with.

The \texttt{dictionaryLanguage} metamodel is only one of two that we'll be using to specify the TGG transformation. After all, TGGs typically require separate
source and target metamodels. The second metamodel involved in the transformation will be eMoflon's standard \texttt{MocaTree} language
(Fig.~\ref{mocaTreeMetamodel}).\footnote{MOCA stands for Moflon Code Adapter (Not coffee, sorry.)} It basically combines concepts from a filesystem (folders and
files), XML (text-only nodes and attributes), and a general indexed containment hierarchy.\footnote{This is done with an index attribute, which can be used to
demand a certain \emph{order} of nodes in a tree which is otherwise not guaranteed by default.} It is provided by our Eclipse plugin and is automatically added
to the build path, so it won't actually appear anywhere in your Eclipse workspace. For starters, let's create the TGG project that will implement our
model-to-text transformation.

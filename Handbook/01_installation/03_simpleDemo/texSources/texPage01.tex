\item[$\blacktriangleright$] You should immediately have 3 folders available in your project explorer - ``Demo,'' ``DoubleLinkedListLanguage,'' and ``TextualMoslDemoLanguage.'' Initially, you'll see a red exclamation and an error, but give eclipse a few seconds to refresh, and then there shouldn't be any problems.  

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] While you're here, feel free to explore the ``Demo'' folder! It has the basic code that forms this demo, and we reccommend reading it over at least once to try and understand the general syntax. This is the modeling language Ecore, and this is how the rest of your tutorial will be written. Don't worry if you've never worked with it before - we provide plenty of help and references throughout the parts. 

In the meantime, please do not rename, move, or delete anything.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] You should immediately have 3 folders available in your project explorer - ``Demo,'' ``DoubleLinkedListLanguage,'' and ``TextualMoslDemoLanguage.'' Initially, you'll see a red exclamation and an error, but once you give Eclipse a few seconds to refresh, there shouldn't be any problems.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] That's it! You're all set up! But, while you're here, feel free to explore the ``Demo'' folder! It has the basic code that forms this demo, and we reccommend reading it over at least once to try and understand the general syntax. This is the ecore Metamodel, one of two needed to generate code through the Ecore Modeling Framework (EMF).

In the meantime, please do not rename, move, or delete anything.

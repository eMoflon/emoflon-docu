You can see that a creation reference is made from Next to Previous, but the matching creation reference for Previous to Next is not. It's simply not needed! MOSL takes care of these automatically - you'll never have an issue with `hanging' links. It works for reference removal as well; You can see that there is a destroy command on {\texttt ``@this.''} It gets rid of the node, but it doesn't do anything about the previous and next references defined on it. That's because when the node is removed, everything attached to it will also be cleaned and updated.
 
So that's a quick overview of the MOSL language but again, how to we generate code from all of this?

First, eMoflon does not do a compelete code generation. Only the parser and error detection starts when you save files to improve performance. This means, to build the program, we need to press the ``Clean and Build'' from the eMoflon context menu when you right click on your working set. Alternatively, you can just press the ``Build'' icon beside the ``New Metamodel'' icon on the toolbar. 

Second, this is actually where Eclipse's EMF kicks in! Right when you save it! The .genmodel was automatically created - all we needed to make was the .ecore model. By invoking the ``Build" command above, code generation was initalized and completed. The subsection that follows offers a general code generation discussion, as it's virtually the same as it's visual counterpart.

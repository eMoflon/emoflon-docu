\subsection{Your Enterprise Architect Workspace}

Now\hypertarget{projectStructure vis}{} that everything is installed and setup properly, let's take a closer look at the different workspaces and our workflow.
Before we continue, please make a few slight adjustments to Enterprise Architect (EA) so you can easily compare your current workspace to our screenshots:
\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Select ``Tools/Options/Standard Colors'' in EA, and set your colours to reflect Fig.~\ref{fig_standardColoursEA}.
This is advisable but you are, of course, free to choose your own colour schema.

\vspace{0.5cm}

  \caption{Our choice of standard colours for diagrams in EA}
  \label{fig_standardColoursEA}
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] In the same dialogue, go to ``Diagram/Appearance'' and reflect the settings in Fig.~\ref{fig_standardAppearanceEA}.
Again, this is just a suggestion and not mandatory.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Last but not least, and still in the same dialogue, find ``Source Code Engineering'' and be sure to choose \texttt{Ecore} as the
default language for code generation (Fig.~\ref{fig_standardSCEEA}). This setting \emph{is} mandatory, and very important.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{standardAppearance}
  \caption{Our choice of the standard appearance for model elements}
  \label{fig_standardAppearanceEA}
\end{figure}

%\nxtPage{\thepage}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{standardCodeEngineering}
    \caption{Make sure you set the standard language to \texttt{Ecore}}

In your EA `workspace' (actually referred to as an \emph{EA project}), take a careful  look at the project browser:  The root node \texttt{Demo} is called a
\emph{model} in EA lingo, and is used as a container to group a set of related \emph{packages}. In our case, \texttt{Demo}  consists of a single package
\texttt{DoubleLinkedListLanguage}. An EA project however, can consist of numerous models that in turn, group numerous packages.

Now switch back to your Eclipse workspace and note the two nodes named \texttt{Spe\-ci\-fi\-ca\-tions} and \texttt{Demo} (Fig.~\ref{fig_eclipsePS}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{eclipse_visPackageExplorer}
    \caption{Project structure}
    \label{fig_eclipsePS}
 \end{figure}

%\nxtPage{\thepage}

These nodes, used to group related \emph{Eclipse projects} in an Eclipse workspace, are called \emph{working sets}. The working set
\texttt{Spe\-ci\-fi\-ca\-tions} contains all \emph{metamodel projects} in a  workspace. Your metamodel project contains a single EAP (EA project) file and is
used to communicate with EA and initiate code generation by simply pressing F5 or choosing \texttt{Refresh} from the context menu.
In our case, \texttt{Specifications} should contain a single metamodel project \texttt{Demo} containing our EA project file  \texttt{Demo.eap}.
 
Figure~\ref{fig_fromEAtoEclipse} depicts how the Eclipse working set \texttt{Demo} and its contents were generated from the EA model \texttt{Demo}. Every model
in EA is mapped to a working set in Eclipse with the same name. From every package in the EA model, an Eclipse project is generated, also with the same name.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fromEAToEclipse}
    \caption{From EA to Eclipse}
    \label{fig_fromEAtoEclipse}
\end{figure}

These projects, however, are of a different \emph{nature} than, for example metamodel projects or normal Java projects. These are called \emph{repository
projects}. A nature is Eclipse lingo for ``project type'' and is visually indicated by a corresponding nature icon on the project folder.
Our metamodel projects sport a neat little class diagram symbol. Repository projects are generated automatically with a certain project structure according to
our conventions.

The \texttt{model} subfolder in the Eclipse package explorer is probably the most important as it contains the \emph{Ecore model} for the project. Ecore is a
metamodelling language that provides building blocks such as \emph{classes} and \emph{references} for defining the  static structure (concepts and relations
between concepts) of a system. This folder also contains a \emph{Genmodel}, the second model required by the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) to generate Java
code.

Looking back to Fig.~\ref{fig_fromEAtoEclipse}, realize that it also depicts how the class \texttt{Node} in the EA model is mapped to the Java interface
\texttt{Node}. Double-click \texttt{Node.java} and take a look at the methods declared in the interface. These correspond directly to the methods declared in
the modelled \texttt{Node} class.

As indicated by the source folders \texttt{src}, \texttt{injection}, and \texttt{gen}, we advocate a clean separation of hand-written (should be placed in
\texttt{src} and \texttt{injection}) and generated code (automatically in \texttt{gen}). As we shall see later in the handbook, hand-written code can be
integrated in generated classes via \emph{injections}. This is sometimes necessary for small helper functions.

Have you noticed the methods of the \texttt{Node} class in our EA model?  Now hold on tight -- each method can be \emph{modelled} completely in EA and the
corresponding implementation in Java is generated automatically and placed in \texttt{NodeImpl.java}.
Just in case you didn't get it: The behavioural or dynamic aspects of a system can be completely modelled in an abstract, platform (programming language)
independent fashion using a blend of activity  diagrams and a ``graph pattern'' language called \textit{Story Driven Modelling}~(SDM).

%\nxtPage{\thepage}

In our EA project, these \emph{Story Diagrams} or simply \emph{SDM}s, are placed in SDM Containers named according to the method they implement.
E.g.  \texttt{$\guillemotleft$SDM Activity$\guillemotright$ insertNodeAfter SDM} for the method \texttt{insertNodeAft\-er(Node)} as depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig_fromEAtoEclipse}.  We'll dedicate Part III of the handbook to understanding why SDMs are so  {\huge crazily} cool!

To recap all we've discussed, let's consider the complete workflow as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_Overview}.
We started with a concise model in EA, simple and independent of any platform specific details~(1).  Our EA model consists not only of static aspects modelled
as a class diagram~(2), but also of dynamic aspects modelled using SDM~(3).  After exporting the model and code generation~(4), we basically switch from
\emph{modelling} to \emph{programming} in a specific general purpose programming language (Java).
On this lower \emph{level of abstraction}, we can flesh out the generated repository~(5) if necessary, and mix as appropriate with hand-written code and
libraries.  Our abstract specification of behaviour (methods) in SDM is translated to a series of method calls that form the body of the corresponding Java
method~(6).

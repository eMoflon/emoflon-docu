\section{Validate your installation with JUnit}

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] In\hypertarget{validate common}{} the Eclipse workspace, choose ``Working Sets'' as your top level element in the package explorer (Fig.~\ref{fig_topLevel}). We work with many working sets, and use them to structure the workspace in Eclipse.

\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] The files have now been restructured and sorted into three nodes. The organization for these nodes will be explained in a moment but for now, check out ``Other Projects/DemoTestSuite.'' This is the testing unit imported with the demo files to make sure everything has been installed and set up correctly. Right click on the project to bring up the context menu and press ``Run As/JUnit Test.'' If anything goes wrong, try refereshing by choosing folders and pressing  \texttt{F5}, or right-clicking and selecting ``Refresh.''

Congratulations!  If you see a green bar  (Fig.~\ref{fig_passedTest}), then everything has been set up correctly and you are now ready to start metamodelling!

For large-scale models, efficiency is essential in this respect. In this paper, we present an improved model synchronization algorithm based on triple graph grammars that is highly efficient and, therefore, can also synchronize large-scale models sufficiently fast. We can show, that the overall algorithm has optimal complexity if it is dominating the rule matching and further present extensive measurements that show the efficiency of the presented model transformation and synchronization technique. },

  abstract = {The mantra of every experienced web application developer is the same: thou shalt separate business logic from display. Ironically, almost all template engines allow violation of this separation principle, which is the very impetus for HTML template engine development. This situation is due mostly to a lack of formal definition of separation and fear that enforcing separation emasculates a template's power. I show that not only is strict separation a worthy design principle, but that we can enforce separation while providing a potent template engine. I demonstrate my StringTemplate engine, used to build jGuru.com and other commercial sites, at work solving some nontrivial generational tasks.My goal is to formalize the study of template engines, thus, providing a common nomenclature, a means of classifying template generational power, and a way to leverage interesting results from formal language theory. I classify three types of restricted templates analogous to Chomsky's type 1..3 grammar classes and formally define separation including the rules that embody separation.Because this paper provides a clear definition of model-view separation, template engine designers may no longer blindly claim enforcement of separation. Moreover, given theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, programmers no longer have an excuse to entangle model and view.}

abstract = {Triple graph grammars (TGGs) have been invented 15 years ago as a formalism for the declarative specification of bidirectional graph-to-graph translations. In this paper we present a list of still open problems concerning the interpretation and the expressiveness of TGGs. We will comment on extensions proposed to improve the original approach and the drawbacks that arise thereof. Consequently a more precise formalization of compulsory properties of the translation of triple graph grammars into forward and backward graph translation functions is given. Regarding these properties an interpretation and implementation of negative application conditions is derived that does not destroy the benefits of the original approach. Additionally a new demand-driven forward/backward translation rule application strategy is proposed. It guarantees for the first time automatically a correct ordering of rule applications without imposing any additional requirements on the structure of the regarded graphs.},

@inproceedings{Hermann2011a,
abstract = {Triple graph grammars (TGGs) have been used successfully to analyze correctness and completeness of bidirectional model transformations, but a corresponding formal approach to model synchronization has been missing. This paper closes this gap by providing a formal synchronization framework with bidirectional update propagation operations. They are generated from a TGG, which specifies the language of all consistently integrated source and target models. As a main result, we show that the generated synchronization framework is correct and complete, provided that forward and backward propagation operations are deterministic. Correctness essentially means that the propagation operations preserve consistency. Moreover, we analyze the conditions under which the operations are inverse to each other. All constructions and results are motivated and explained by a small running example using concrete visual syntax and abstract syntax notation based on typed attributed graphs.},

\section{The Transformation Protocol}

\genHeader

For the interested reader, we have included some content on the details of the protocol file that's generated in pair with the correspondence file with every
TGG transformation. A protocol lists every small detail involved in the transformation process, listing its history of elements checked, listing the possible
transformations, attempting each one, and describing the result. While similar to the integrator which we learnt how to use in Part 3, Section 6, the protocol
contains more information than the visualisation, and can be extremely useful when debugging your project.

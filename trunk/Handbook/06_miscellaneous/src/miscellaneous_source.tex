Welcome to the miscellanous Part of the eMoflon handbook. Here we have collected and documented a series of advanced topics related to our tool. These include
some tips and tricks while using the tool with Enterprise Architect (EA), a syntax reference table of the Moflon Specification Language (MOSL), and
information about the protocol file generated with every Triple Graph Grammar (TGG) transformation that we were never able to explain in Parts IV or V. This part is kept
rather compact, and intended to be used mainly as a reference, consulted on demand.

Please note that if you're looking for instructions on how to properly export and import separate metamodels into the same project for work with TGG
transformations, please refer to Part IV, Section 2.2 and 2.3, where we included detailed steps in the context of an example.

If you feel anything is missing from this Part, or if you have any other comments or suggestions about the handbook and eMoflon, feel free to contact us anytime

% Intro to the part (rather than a separate file\ldots)
This part contains: All references for further reading. We have tried to collect and document a series of advanced topics related to eMoflon and EA. It is kept
rather compact and is meant to be used mainly as a reference, to be consulted on demand. Just for good measure, we've also included the GNU General public
Liscense.

\section{Using Existing EMF Projects in eMoflon}
\genHeader

This chapter contains stepwise instructions on how to use existing \mbox{EMF}/\-Ecore projects with an eMoflon project.  As an example, we shall implement a
small subset of the \texttt{Ecore -> GenModel} transformation. The \emph{GenModel} for a given Ecore model can be viewed as a \emph{wrapper} that contains
additional Java code generation specific details. These details are separated from the Ecore model to keep it free of such ``low-level'' information and
settings.

As the metamodel for \textsf{GenModels} is part of the EMF/Ecore standard, this is an example of an existing metamodel which must be integrated in eMoflon
before you can, for example, specify the transformation using SDMs.
Based on this example, the basic workflow for using an existing EMF project in eMoflon is described in the following.

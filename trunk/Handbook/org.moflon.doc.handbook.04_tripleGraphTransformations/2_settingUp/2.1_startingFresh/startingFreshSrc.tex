\subsection{Get Eclipse}
\label{sec:get-eclipse}

Navigate to \url{https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/} and download the latest \texttt{Eclipse Modeling Tools}.\footnote{We have tested this part of the handbook for \texttt{Eclipse Mars.2 (4.5.2)} running on Mac OS X Yosemite and Windows 8.}
Do not try to use another Eclipse package as it probably won't work.

\subsection{Install eMoflon}
\label{sec:get-emoflon}

Install eMoflon as an Eclipse plugin from this update site.\footnote{\url{http://www.emoflon.org/fileadmin/download/moflon-ide/eclipse-plugin/beta/update-site2/}}
When installing, make sure you choose to install \emph{all} available features.

If you don't already have Graphviz dot installed on your system then install it:  \texttt{http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php}

\subsection{Install your initial workspace}
\label{sec:loadSourceMeta}

To get started in Eclipse, press the ``Install, configure and deploy Moflon'' button and navigate to ``Install Workspace''. 
Choose ``Handbook Example (Part 4)'' (Fig.~\ref{eclipse:downPartIV}). 
It contains the \texttt{Leitners\-Learning\-Box} and \texttt{Dictionary\-Language} metamodels, which we'll be using. 
By the way, don't freak out if your workspace looks slightly different than our screenshots -- things often change faster than we can update this handbook.
If the difference is important and confusing, however, please send us an email:  \url{contact@moflon.org}

If everything went well, you should now have two projects in your workspace.  
Go ahead and explore the metamodels (\texttt{/model/*.ecore}, \texttt{/model/*.aird}).
The generated code (\texttt{/gen}) is standard EMF code.

If you ever want to create your own ``repository'' projects, eMoflon provides a wizard (``Create new repository project'' in the eMoflon toolbar) for this, which creates the expected project structure with an empty ecore file that you can fill out.

\section{Extending your transformation}
\genHeader

At this point, we now have a working TGG to transform a \texttt{Dictionary} into a \texttt{Box} with three \texttt{partition}s, and a \texttt{Box} with
exactly three \texttt{Partition}s into a \texttt{Dictionary}. The only potential problem is that a learning box with only three partitions may not be the most
useful studying tool. After all, the more partitions you have, the more practice you'll have with the cards by being quizzed again and again.

Our goal was never to be able to put an \texttt{Entry} into
partitions with indices greater than two,\footnote{As resolved in the \texttt{IndexTolevel} implementation} but simply to be able to put any \texttt{card} into
a \texttt{Dictionary}. This means that such additional partitions are irrelevant for the dictionary and should be ignored. 
In this particular case, you should specify
an extra rule that clearly states how such partitions should be ignored, i.e., be translated without affecting the dictionary. In this spirit, let's add a new
rule to handle additional partitions. We could keep things simple by extending the existing \texttt{BoxToDictionaryRule} by connecting a fourth partition, but
what if we wanted a fifth one? A sixth? As you can see, this obviously won't work -- there will always be the potential for a \texttt{n+1}th partition in an \texttt{n}-sized box. 

While building this so-called \emph{ignore rule}\define{ignore rule}, keep in mind that the goal is to handle any additional elements and their connecting link variables in \texttt{Box}.
This means we don't need to create any new elements in the \texttt{Dictionary}.

Before specifying the ignore rule, extend your model \texttt{fwd.src.xmi} by a new \texttt{partition3} (with \texttt{index} = 3) as depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:ea_extended_fwd_src_xmi}.
Connect your \texttt{partition3}  to \texttt{partition0} via a \texttt{previous} reference, and connect also \texttt{partition2} to \texttt{partition3} via a \texttt{next} reference.
Create a new \texttt{card} in your new \texttt{partition3} as well.
If you run your transformation again, you will just get some errors for the forward direction as our \texttt{fwd.src.xmi} with four \texttt{partition}s simply cannot be handled with our TGG.

ToDo: Well\ldots everything. Solve information loss! Then you can move on to world hunger.

Especially with this new rule, there will be information in that very first transformation that gets lost. I.e., When entries become cards: there's no way to
know how many or in which partitions they were sorted into, so they would be split exclusively between three.

or, partitions to entries, we don't know how many partitions will exist, but we know for sure there will only be three difficulties so, on that first
transformation, they will be assigned a value. We slightly addressed this in our implementation code (ie. if index (partition number) was greater than four,
auto-assign to 2) 

when you go from partition to dictionary with 5 partitions, thexy get split and sorted into three levels. then, when you switch back, they're split only into
three partitions - there's no possible way to get those other 2* partitions back.

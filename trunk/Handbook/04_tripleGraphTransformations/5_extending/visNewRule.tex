When the \texttt{BoxToDictionary} doesn't work, this comes into play. It find the starter position then matches to a partition, n. You can see from the
constraint that the index for the additional partition adds 1 to n, so that the newest partition becomes n+1. Remember, the black are things that are already
established. The green indicates that there is no object like that currently in the transformation.

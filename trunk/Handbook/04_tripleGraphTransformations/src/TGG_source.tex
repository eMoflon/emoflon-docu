% Setting up (or starting fresh)
\input{../1_gettingStarted/gettingStartedSrc}

% Declares ONE correspondence type: BoxToDictionary
\input{../2_schema/schemaSrc}

% Develops BoxToDictionaryRule, CardToEntryRule, Builds (three repo projects), then explains the custom attribute constraint
\input{../3_rules/rulesSrc}

% Should run successfully on exclusively THREE partitions in BOX; creates one instance, runs it, renames it, ta daa
\input{../4_inAction/actionSrc}

% Explain how works via INTEGRATOR (Part I) (NOTE. new interface?)
\input{../5_integrator/integratorSrc}

% Introduce PROBLEM: well, even if it doesn't have capacity to deal with 4, 3 should still work. Introduce new rule
\input{../6_extendingTransformation/extendSplash}

% now works -> integrator with breakpoints !!!!! NOT YET DEVELOPED: YOU MUST DO. DUN DUN DUNNNNNN (NOTE. new interface?)
\input{../7_breakpoints/breakpointsSrc}


% Synchronization (To deal with data loss: i.e., from partition to entry and back : no way to put say, fourth partition BACK in fourth)

Unfortunately, before you're able get started with  TGGs, you need to have two metamodels already prepared - a source and a target. Our source will be
\texttt{LearningBoxLanguage}, which was built and completed in Parts II and III. The target will be \texttt{Dictionarylanguage}, which was included in the .zip
folder downloaded from eMoflon's project website along with this handbook. The instructions for properly importing the metamodel into the same project are
cruicial as both metamodels must be in the same project in order to properly specify an integration with TGGs.

If you've just joined us in this part, complete Section~\ref{sec:loadSourceMeta} to load \texttt{Learn\-ing\-Box\-Lang\-uage}. 

If you've completed Part III however, skip ahead to the target metamodel import instructions, either \texttt{Section~\ref{sec:multiEAP} (Visual)} or
\texttt{Section~\ref{sec:multiMOSL} (Textual)} depending on your specification type.

\subsection{Loading the source metamodel}
\label{sec:loadSourceMeta}
\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To get started, press the \texttt{new} button on the toolbar and navigate to ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/''
(Fig.~\ref{fig:downPartIV}).

\end{figure}

\clearpage

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] We have created two ``cheat'' packages based on the eMolfon specification type you prefer. Read Section 1 from Part I for details
on the differences between the types. The packages contain the entire metamodel as built in the previous handbooks.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] If your package explorer does not look similar to ours in Fig.~\ref{fig:workingSets} with at least two distinct nodes, select the
small, downward facing arrow in the corner of the module window. Choose ``Working Sets'' as your ``Top Level Elements.'' We use these to structure the
workspace in Eclipse.

We recommend reading the overview of \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox}, it's purpose and goals, in the introduction to Part II. This will provide the
motivation for creating a TGG with a dictionary language, and may help you understand why certain attributes and links are connected.

** Provided in zip file.. can't simple use the download wizard as that will impoert it into your workspace as a separate project, when we want them to be the
same.

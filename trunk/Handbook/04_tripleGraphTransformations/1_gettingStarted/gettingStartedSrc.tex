\section{Setting up your workspace}
\genHeader

Unfortunately, before you're able get started with  TGGs, you need to have two metamodels -- a source and a target -- already prepared. Our source will be
\texttt{LearningBoxLanguage}, which was built and completed in Parts II and III. The target will be \texttt{Dictionarylanguage}, included in the .zip
folder containing this document. The instructions for properly importing the metamodel into the same project are cruicial as both metamodels must be in the same
project in order to properly specify an integration with TGGs.

If you've just joined us in this part, complete Section~\ref{sec:loadSourceMeta} to load \texttt{Learn\-ing\-Box\-Lang\-uage}. If you've completed Part III
however, skip ahead to your import instructions, either \texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiEAP}{Section 2.2 (Visual)}} or~\texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiMOSL}{Section 2.3
(Textual)}}.

\subsection{Starting Fresh}
\label{sec:loadSourceMeta}
\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To get started, press the \texttt{new} button on the toolbar and navigate to ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/''
(Fig.~\ref{fig:downPartIV}).  We have created two `cheat' packages based on eMolfon's specification types --  pick the one you'd like to learn.\footnote{For a
brief discussion on the differences between the two, refer to Part I, Section I} They both contain the finished model, as completed in the previous handbook
parts.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] After loading, if your package explorer does not look similar to ours in Fig.~\ref{fig:workingSets} with at least two distinct
nodes, select the small, downward facing arrow in the corner of the module window. Choose ``Working Sets/Top Level Elements.'' We use these to structure the
workspace in Eclipse.

\end{itemize}

At this point we recommend reading the overview of \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox}, it's purpose and goals, and how \texttt{card}s are moved between each
\texttt{partition}. You can find this in the introduction of Part II, and hopefully it will provide the motivation and reasonsing behind creating a TGG with
a Dictionary.

\section{Setting up your workspace}
\genHeader

To start any TGG Transformation, you need to have the source and target graphs already prepared. Our example will use the \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox}
metamodel (as completed in Parts II and III) as the transformation's source, and a new \texttt{DictionaryLanguage} as its target. We have provided this
second metamodel as a download.

If you haven't worked through the previous parts of this handbook, complete Section~\ref{sec:loadSourceMeta} first to load a pre-prepared learning box into your
workspace. If your source metamodel is ready however, skip ahead to either \texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiEAP}{Section 2.2 (Visual)}} or
\texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiMOSL}{Section 2.3 (Textual)}} to begin.

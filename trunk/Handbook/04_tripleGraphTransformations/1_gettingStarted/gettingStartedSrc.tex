\section{Setting up your workspace}
\genHeader

Before starting any TGG transformation, you'll need to have the separate source and target metamodels already prepared. In our case, these will be
\texttt{LeitnersLearningBox} and a new \texttt{DictionaryLanguage}. Don't worry - we have created this for you to import into your workspace. If you haven't
completed the previous parts in the handbook series, work through Section~\ref{sec:loadSourceMeta} to load a pre prepared \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox}
metamodel into your workspace. If your source metamodel is ready to go however, skip ahead to  either \texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiEAP}{Section 2.2 (Visual)}}
or \texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiMOSL}{Section 2.3 (Textual)}}.

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Press the \texttt{new} button on the toolbar and navigate to ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/''
(Fig.~\ref{fig:downPartIV}).  We have created two cheat packages based on eMolfon's two specification types. For a brief discussion on the differences between
the two, refer to Part I, Section I. They are both completed with all objects, references, and implemented SDMs.

\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] After loading, if your package explorer does not resemble ours in Fig.~\ref{fig:workingSets} with at least two
distinct nodes, select the small, downward facing arrow in the corner of the module window. Choose ``Working Sets/Top Level Elements.'' To review how these
nodes are used to structure the workspace in Eclipse, check out Part I, Section 4.

At this point we recommend reading the introduction to Part II for a detailed overview of \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox}, its purpose and goals, and how
\texttt{card}s and \texttt{FastCards} are moved between each \texttt{partition}. It should only take a minute or two, and the background information may help
you better understand the reasoning behind some steps in this part as we continue to build on the idea.

\section{Setting up your workspace}

To start any TGG transformation, you need to have the source and target metamodels. Our example will use the \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox} metamodel (as
completed in Parts II and III) as the transformation's source, and a new \texttt{DictionaryLanguage} metamodel as its target.

If you haven't worked through the previous parts of this handbook, complete Section~\ref{sec:loadSourceMeta} first to load a the learning box metamodel into
your workspace. If you already have the source metamodel from working through a previous part however, skip ahead to either
\texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiEAP}{Section 2.2 (Visual)}} or \texttt{\hyperlink{sec:multiMOSL}{Section 2.3 (Textual)}} to begin.

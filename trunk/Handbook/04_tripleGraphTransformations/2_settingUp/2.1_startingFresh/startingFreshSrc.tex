\subsection{Starting Fresh}
\label{sec:loadSourceMeta}
\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Press the \texttt{new} button on the Eclipse toolbar and navigate to ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/''
(Fig.~\ref{eclipse:downPartIV}). There are two \texttt{Part IV Fresh Start} cheat packages: one for our visual syntax, the other for our textual
syntax. They each contain the full \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox} metamodel, as well as each method implemented as an SDM and an example instance in
``LearningBoxLanguage/instances/''. If you need help deciding which syntax to use, refer to Part I, Section 1.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] After loading, if your workspace does not resemble ours in Fig.~\ref{eclipse:workingSets}, with eMoflon's ``Build'' icon on the
tooolbar and a package explorer with at least two distinct nodes, first switch to the eMoflon perspective by navigating to ``Window/Open
Perspective/Other\ldots'' and choosing ``eMoflon'' from the list. Then, select the small downward-facing arrow in the upper right corner of the package
explorer. ``Top Level Elements/Working Sets.'' To review how these nodes are used to structure our workspace in Eclipse, check out Part I, Section 4.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Fantastic -- you now have the source metamodel for your transformation ready to go!

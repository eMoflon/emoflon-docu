\subsection{AllOtherCardsRule}
\visHeader

Please note that you can start any new rule (especially this one) in two different ways! You can either return to the \texttt{rules} diagram and use the toolbox
there, or knowing that you need \texttt{box} and \texttt{partition0} from the context of the transformation, you can \emph{derive} this rule via
\texttt{BoxToDictionaryRule}.

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Once you've initialized the \texttt{AllOtherCardsRule} diagram, build the rule until it matches
Fig.~\ref{fig:ea_allOtherCardsRule}.

\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] As you can see, this rule doesn't assume to know the final \texttt{partition} in the transformation. It matches to some
\texttt{n}th partition with an \texttt{index} 2 or more, then connects a new \texttt{n+1}th partition to \texttt{n} and \texttt{partition0}. 

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Save, validate, export, and refresh your Eclipse package explorer to generate code for this rule. Run the TGG again - it works! The
transformation is now able to handle the troublesome \texttt{next} dangling edge from the third partition.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Feel free to go ahead and add as many \texttt{partition}s and \texttt{card}s as you like. Your TGG is now able to handle a
\texttt{box} with any number of \texttt{partition}s. 

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To see how this rule is specified in the textual syntax, check out Fig.~\ref{fig:eclipse_allOtherCardsRule} in the next section.

\end{itemize}

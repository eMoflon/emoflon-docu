\section{Creating your TGG schema}
\genHeader

With the target and source components prepared in the workspace, the first true step towards completing any TGG is to model the correspondence component of your
future triple.\define{Link \\ Metamodel}This correspondence or \emph{link metamodel} helps to drive the forward transformation, and is made up of
\emph{correspondence types}\define{Correspondence Types}which connect classes between the source and target metamodels. These special types can also be thought
of as traceability links.

While the link metamodel is really just a standard metamodel, we use slightly different naming conventions and concrete syntaxes to represent it.\define{TGG
Schema} Together, the overall metamodel triple consisting of the relevant parts of the source, link, and target metamodels is called the \emph{TGG
schema}.

A TGG schema can be viewed as the (metamodel) triple to which all \emph{new} triples must conform. In less technical lingo, it gives an abstract view on the
relationships (correspondence) between two metamodels or domains. A domain expert should be able to understand why certain connected elements are related,
irrespective of how the relationship is actually established by TGG rules, just by looking at the TGG schema. 


In our example schema, we will create a link between our source \texttt{Box} and target \texttt{Dictionary}.

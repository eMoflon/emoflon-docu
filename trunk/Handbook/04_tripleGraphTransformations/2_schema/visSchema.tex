\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Open \texttt{LeitnersLearningBox} in EA, and add a new package to your model root, \texttt{My Working Set}. Name it
\texttt{Learning\-Box\-To\-Dictionary\-Integration} (Fig.~\ref{fig:intgPackage}).

  \caption{Create a new package}  
  \label{fig:intgPackage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Create a diagram in the new package, selecting \texttt{TGG Schema} as diagram type (Fig.~\ref{fig:tgg_diagram_type}). The diagram
type indicates to EA that the new package is a TGG Project.

\vspace{0.5cm}

  \caption{Choose \texttt{TGG Schema} as your diagram type}  
  \label{fig:tgg_diagram_type}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] A dialogue should pop up asking you for the source and target projects of your TGG project.  Choose
\texttt{Learning\-Box\-Language} as source and \texttt{Dictionary\-Language} as target project and affirm with \texttt{OK} (Fig.~\ref{fig:select_source_target}).

  \label{fig:select_source_target}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] The structure of your TGG project should now resemble Fig.~\ref{fig:new_tgg_project}. Please note that a subpackage \texttt{Rules}
and an underlying diagram with the same name are also generated. \update -- started from the wrong EAP

\end{itemize}

Now it's time to insert classes from our source and target projects into our TGG project and declare our first \emph{correspondence type} between them.
The classes \texttt{Box} and \texttt{Dictionary} are to be related to each other.

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Hold \texttt{ctrl}, then drag-and-drop the \texttt{Box} class from \texttt{Learning\-Box\-Language} into the newly
created TGG schema diagram, which should have automatically opened in the editor when you made it. Ensure that the class is pasted \texttt{as a simple link} into the
diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:TGGdragDrop})

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ea_TGGDragDrop}
  \caption{Copying an element as a simple link} 
  \label{fig:TGGdragDrop}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Note that you are able to set \texttt{Autosave Selection as default}. In fact, we did this in the previous Part! We'll need to
switch drag types several times during this part however, so it's best to leave this unchecked if you do not want to hold \texttt{ctrl} each time you use this
gesture.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] With a class from both source and target metamodels, we can now create a correspondence type between them! Quick-link from
\texttt{Box} to \texttt{Dictionary}, and select \texttt{Create TGG Corres\-pon\-dence Type} (Fig.~\ref{fig:create_correspondence}).

  \caption{Creating a TGG correspondence type} 
  \label{fig:create_correspondence}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] As you can see, a correspondence type has been created, visualised via a hexagonal shape. It is automatically named
\texttt{BoxToDiction\-ary}, and the relevant references have been generated.

% Can this be omitted? Users create a new one on the fly?
% \item[$\blacktriangleright$] To finish our TGG schema, declare a second correspondence type in the same file between \texttt{Card} and \texttt{Entry}. You'll
% notice that the reference between \texttt{Dictionary} and \texttt{Entry} was automatically created! Your completed TGG Schema should resemble
% Fig.~\ref{fig:complete_tgg_schema}.

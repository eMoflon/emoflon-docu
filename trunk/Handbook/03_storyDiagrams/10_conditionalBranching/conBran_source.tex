When working with SDMs, you often need to choose between two different patterns based on the return value of an arbitrary (black box) operation.
This is like the normal \texttt{Success}/\texttt{Failure} construction, but instead of a pattern being matched or failing, the decision can be implemented with
a another SDM or a standard Java method. This feature is a further means (besides \texttt{MethodCallExpressions} for attribute values and \texttt{Bindings}) of
integrating hand-written Java code in SDMs (and can lead to spaghetti SDMs so please use with caution!).

As an example, consider a class \texttt{A} with an operation:
\begin{quote}
 \mbox{\texttt{doSomeCheck(p$_1$,\ldots,p$_n$ :EClass) :EBoolean}}
\end{quote}

This method could be implemented in hand-written Java code or be specified by another SDM specification.

Although dummy boolean attributes \emph{could} be used to achieve the same effect, it is much simpler to branch the control flow based on the result of a \texttt{StatementNode}.
If the method returns an \texttt{EBoolean}, \texttt{Success} and \texttt{Failure} correspond to \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}, respectively. If the method returns anything else, then \texttt{Failure} corresponds to \texttt{null}. Void methods \emph{cannot} be used to branch and an exception is thrown during code generation.

Figure~\ref{fig:cond_branch_on_op} depicts the class \texttt{A}, and shows how \texttt{doSomeCheck} is used to branch in an SDM.

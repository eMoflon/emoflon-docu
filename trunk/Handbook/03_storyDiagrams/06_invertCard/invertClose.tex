Before we start the next SDM, lets quickly review one thing. Have you considered why the \texttt{temp} object is bound in the \texttt{swap variables}
pattern, but not in \texttt{initialize temp} where it's first defined? This is a new case for bound variables that we haven't treated yet!

Until now, we have seen object variables that can be bound to (1) an argument of the method (set when the method is invoked), or (2) the
current object (\texttt{this}) whose method is invoked. In both cases, the object to be matched is completely determined by the context of the method before
the matcher starts. It does not need to be evaluated at random by the pattern matcher.

Setting \texttt{temp} as bound in \texttt{Swap variables} is a third case in which an object is bound to a value determined in a \emph{previous} node. In
this SDM, this means \texttt{temp} will be bound to the value(s) recently determined for a variable of the same name in the previous node, \texttt{Initialize
temp}. This binding feature therefore prevents data loss by enabling you to refer to previous matches for object variables in the preceding control flow. In
essence, this third type of binding state is limited to the scope of the pattern matcher instance.

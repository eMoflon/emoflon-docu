\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] You're no longer an SDM beginner, so create two patterns in the invert declaration, named \texttt{initializeTemp} and
\texttt{swapVariable}. The only flow this method requires is that these pattern are performed in order - there's no assertion, and it only needs to be
performed once. Don't forget to include a return statement!

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Your declaration should now resemble Fig.~\ref{fig:eclipse_invert}

\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Create two bounded object variables in each pattern, and complete the rules until your patterns resemble
Fig.~\ref{fig:invertPatterns}.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Believe it or not, that's it! We reccommend building at this point, just to confirm nothing has gone wrong with your metamodel. To
see this method in the visual syntax, review Fig.~\ref{fig:sdm_invert}.

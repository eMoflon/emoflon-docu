This next SDM \emph{inverts} a card by swapping its back and face values (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_invert}). This therefore ``turns a card around'' in the learning
box. This action makes sense if a user wants to try learning, for example, the definition of a word in the opposite direction. Instead of guessing the
definition of every word when presented with the term, perhaps they would like to guess the term when presented with the defintion. This method doesn't need to
accept any paramters, as it uses a bounded \texttt{this} variable.

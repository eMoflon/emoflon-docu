\section{Removing a card}
\hypertarget{sec:remCard}{}

Since we're just getting started with SDM's, we'll begin with a straightforward diagram. The goal of this SDM is to remove a single card from its current
partition (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_removeCard}).

According to the signature of the method \texttt{removeCard}, we should return the card that has been deleted. Although this might strike you as slightly odd,
considering that we already passed in this exact card as an argument, it still makes sense as it allows for chaining method calls:
\begin{quote}\texttt{aPartition.removeCard(aCard).invert()}\end{quote}

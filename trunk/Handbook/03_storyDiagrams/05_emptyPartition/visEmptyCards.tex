\begin{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] To create a \emph{for each} story node in EA, create the initial diagram and start node for the method \texttt{Partition::empty},
then \emph{quick create} an activity node choosing \texttt{ForEach} as its type (Fig.~\ref{fig:sdm_foreach}). A \emph{for each} story node is visualised as a
double node to indicate potential repetition.

\vspace{1cm}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Next, complete the story pattern as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:sdm_end}. Please note that the \texttt{card} that is deleted in each match
is unbound, and both the \texttt{card} and link to \texttt{this} are set to \texttt{destroy}. Even more important, notice that the guard that terminates the for
each story node has an \texttt{[end]} guard. Indeed, a \emph{for each} story node \emph{must} have an end activity edge which is taken when all matches for the
story pattern have been handled.

\fancyfoot[R]{ $\triangleright$ \hyperlink{sec:invertCard}{Next SDM} } \item[$\blacktriangleright$] Done! That's all we needed to do to specify a repeating
action. Pretty easy, eh? As before, skip over the link below to see how \texttt{empty} is implemented using eMoflon's textual syntax, or click to proceed.

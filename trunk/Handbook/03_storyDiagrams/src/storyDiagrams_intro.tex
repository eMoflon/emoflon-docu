% Rewrite and expand!
% Explain WHY we use SDMs?
% Graphically, the advantage is obvious. (pictures, class diagrams, containement) textually, you can see a clear distinction between the two semantic
% types, as it separates all the actitivies into separate files, folders, and patterns.

In this part, we introduce unidirectional model transformations via programmed graph transformations using Story Driven Modeling (SDM). SDMs focus on concrete
implementations, so we'll implement the methods signatures we previously declared as part of the system's abstract syntax. It other words, we'll be building
our dynamic semantics! Don't let the sheer size of this part frighten you off - we've included deep, thorough explanations and an ample number of images to
ensure clarity - it's really not so bad.

Welcome to Part III, an introduction to unidirectional model transformations via programmed graph transformations using Story Driven Modeling (SDM).
SDMs focus on concrete implementations, so we plan to implement the methods signatures declared in the abstract syntax. It other words, this is where you'll
build your metamodel's dynamic semantics! Don't let the sheer size of this part frighten you off. We have included deep, thorough explanations (with an ample
number of figures) to ensure the concepts are crystal clear - it's really not that bad.

In Part II, we learned that we can implement methods in a straightforward manner with injections and Java code, so why bother with SDMs? 

Overall, SDMs are a simpler, alternate way of implementing methods. Rather than building verbose Java code yourself, you can model each action individually then
generate the corresponding code to implement it. With the visual syntax, the advantage is obvious. You'll be able to use familiar, easy-to-understand UML
activity diagrams to establish your methods. Texually, SDMs extend the Objected Oriented Paradigm by separating all classes, references, and activities into
different files, folders, and patterns.

started right away. If you're continuing from Part II, click the link below to continue with your constructed learning box metamodel.

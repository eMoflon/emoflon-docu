\section{Conclusion and next steps}

\vspace{0.5cm}

Congratulations - you've reached the end of eMoflon's introduction to unidirectional model transformations! You've learnt that SDMs are declared inside method
\emph{activities}, which can be comprised of different \emph{activities} (\emph{pattern}s) and \emph{statements} (method calls). \emph{Patterns} are made up of
various \emph{Object} and \emph{Link Variables} with their own set of \texttt{rules}. These variables can be given different \emph{binding states}, depending on
their purpose. You have also learnt how to make a \emph{deterministic} pattern matcher with \emph{NACs}.

To test your story driven modelling skills, challenge yourself to try:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a method/pattern to eject the card from the final partition (to signal it's been learnt)
\item Editing \texttt{Partition.empty()} to include a method call to \texttt{removeCard} to reuse this previous SDM
\item Modifying the GUI source files to execute more methods
\end{itemize}

Otherwise, if you enjoyed this section, continue to Part IV to learn about Triple Graph Transformations, or even onto Part V for Model-to-Text Transformations.
The final part of this handbook (Part VI: Miscellaneous), goes over tips and tricks in EA which you might find useful when creating SDMs in the future.

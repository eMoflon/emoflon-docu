\section{Conclusion and next steps}

\vspace{0.5cm}

Congratulations - you've reached the end of eMoflon's unidirectional model transformations! You've learned that SDMs are declared inside method
\emph{activities}, are comprised of different \emph{pattern}s which themselves are made up of various \emph{Object} and \emph{Link Variables}. These
variables can be given different \emph{binding states}, depending on their purpose. You have also learned how to build \emph{NACs}, which make pattern
matches \emph{deterministic} by construction.

To test your Story Driven Modelling skills, challenge yourself to try:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a method/pattern to eject the card from the final partition (to signal it's been learnt)
\item Edit \texttt{Partition.empty} to include a method call to \texttt{removeCard} so you can reuse a previous SDM
\item Modifying the GUI source files to execute the other established methods
\end{itemize}

Otherwise, if you enjoyed this section, continue to Part IV to learn about Triple Graph Transformations, or even onto Part V for Model-to-Text Transformations.
The final part of this handbook (Part VI, Miscellaneous), goes over tips and tricks in EA which you might find useful when creating SDMs in the future.

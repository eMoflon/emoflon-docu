Congratulations, you're almost there! This is the last SDM needed before Leitener's Learning Box is fully functional.

For very simple cards (i.e: words in different language that are similar), it might be a bit annoying to have to answer these cards again and again in
successive partitions. Such \emph{fast} cards should somehow be marked and handled differently. If a fast card is correctly answered once, it should be
immediately moved to the final partition in the box. This way, the card is practiced once, and tested once more before finally being removed from the
box.

It makes sense that a \texttt{FastCard} element inherits a \texttt{Card}, so we'll extend the current object in our metamodel in a new eclass, adding a
new marker to show it behaves differently (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_fastCard}).

In addition to creating a new \texttt{eclass}, we also need to extend the existing \texttt{check} method to check for this special card type once a correct
guess is made. This new pattern faces a similar challenge as \texttt{grow}. A \texttt{FastCard} can't simply progress to the \texttt{next} partition - it
must skip ahead to the absolute last partition in the box. This means another NAC is required to form a deterministic pattern match.

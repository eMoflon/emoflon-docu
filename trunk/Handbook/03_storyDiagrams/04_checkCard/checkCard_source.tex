The next method we shall model with SDMs is probably the most important! A user decides to test themselves on a card in the learning box. They look at the
\texttt{front}, make a guess as to what's on the \texttt{back}, and \emph{checks} to see if their guess was correct (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_check})! If the guess
was correct, the card can be \emph{promoted} by moving it to the \emph{next} partition. If the guess was wrong, the card is \emph{penalized} by being moved
very first partition in the box.

As you can see, the guess itself just a simple assertion. The resulting actions however must be implemented as patterns since they manipulate data in three
unique elements (Fig.~\ref{fig:patterns_check}).

The next method we shall model with SDMs is probably the most important! When user decides to test themselves on a card in the learning box, this is the method
that will be invoked! The user can see the contents on the \texttt{front} of the card, and so they'll make a guess as to what's on the \texttt{back}, and
\emph{check} to see if their guess was correct (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_check}). If true, the card can be \emph{promoted} by moving it to the \emph{next} partition.
If false, the card is \emph{penalized} by being sent to very first partition in the box.

As you can see, checking the guess is simple assertion. The actual movement however, must be implemented as patterns since they manipulate data.
Fig.~\ref{fig:patterns_check} briefly shows the intended creation and deletion links that each of these patterns must make.

Will require an attrib constraint: define.
define: edge guard (if / else)
define: bound vs unbound
define? literal expression (maybe not: applies only to EA)

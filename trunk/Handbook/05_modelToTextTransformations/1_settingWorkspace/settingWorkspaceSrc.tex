\section{Setting up the workspace}
\genHeader

Nowadays, \emph{no one} writes a complex parser completely by hand. Although this is sometimes still necessary for syntactically challenging languages, most
parsers can be quickly whipped up using context-free \emph{string grammars}.\footnote{For simple cases, \emph{regular expressions} can also be used} These are
typically written in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)\define{EBNF}. ANTLR~\cite{ANTLR} is a tool that can generate a parser from this compact specification for
a host of target programming languages, including Java. Although ANTLR might not be the most efficient or powerful parser generator, it is open-source, well
documented and supported, and allows for a pragmatic and elegant fallback to Java when things get nasty and we have to resort to some dirty tricks to get our
job done.

A parser, of course, is based on whatever model it must work with. Given that we want to parse to and from a dictionary, we need to have the
\texttt{DictionaryLanguage} metamodel defined before starting. The dictionary is a relatively simple device, so you have three options to loading this project
into your workspace:

% Options
\begin{description}
% -- Metamodel Screenshots ---
\item[Option 1:] You can start a new metamodel project called \texttt{Dictionary} (Fig.~\ref{eclipse:startMetamodel}) and build the metamodel yourself until it
matches either Fig.~\ref{ea:dictLang} or Fig.~\ref{eclipse:dictLang}.\footnote{Review metamodel construction by working through Part II: Ecore}

% -- Cheat Package(s)
\newpage
\item[Option 2:] You can download our cheat package and load \texttt{Dictionary} into your workspace using the Eclipse ``New" wizard
(Fig.~\ref{eclipse_cheatPackage}).

  \label{eclipse_cheatPackage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Pressing \texttt{Finish} will load either a MOSL directory or \texttt{DictionaryLanguage.eap} file into a working set, depending on
your syntax choice (Fig.~\ref{ea:cheatLoaded} or Fig.~\ref{eclipse:cheatLoaded}).

% -- Export/Import ----
\item[Option 3:] You can simply use the same \texttt{Dictionary} you used in part IV.

\end{description} 
% -- End

This specification is one of two that we'll be using to specify the transformation. We recommend inspecting its metamodel until you feel comfortable with
what you'll be working with. As you'll be able to see, a \texttt{Library} can contain an unlimited number of \texttt{Shelf} and \texttt{Author} elements. Both
of these are connected to a \texttt{Dictionary} container which can also hold an unlimited number of \texttt{Entry} objects.

Our second specification is eMoflon's included \texttt{MocaTree} language. This is automatically included in \emph{every} project, so we can skip ahead to the
next task, which is initializing the \texttt{DictionaryCodeAdapter} TGG project that will drive our Model-to-Text transformation.

\section{Setting up your workspace}
\genHeader

Nowadays, \emph{no one} writes a complex parser completely by hand. Although this is sometimes still necessary for syntactically challenging languages, most
parsers can be quickly whipped up using context-free \emph{string grammars}.\footnote{For simple cases, \emph{regular expressions} can also be used} These are
typically written in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)\define{EBNF}. ANTLR~\cite{ANTLR} is a tool that can generate a parser from this compact specification for
a host of target programming languages, including Java. Although ANTLR might not be the most efficient or powerful parser generator, it's open-source, well
documented and supported, and allows for a pragmatic and elegant fallback to Java when things get nasty and we have to resort to some dirty tricks to get our job done. 

Our example needs a parser to complete the transformation step between a concrete textual file instance and a standard model we'll discuss in a few moments.
It can only generate an editable parser/lexer from an established grammar however, which means we need to initialize our TGG project. We begin by loading a
\texttt{DictionaryLanguage} metamodel into the workspace. The dictionary is a relatively simple device, so you have three ways to do this:


\begin{description}
% -- Develop Metamodel ---
\item[Option 1: Develop] 


\item[$\blacktriangleright$] \hspace{0.3cm} Open Eclipse in an empty workspace, and start a new metamodel project called \texttt{Dict\-ion\-ary}
(Fig.~\ref{eclipse:startMetamodel}).\footnote{Refer to Part II to review metamodel construction} 


\item[$\blacktriangleright$] \hspace{0.3cm} Complete a \texttt{DictionaryLanguage} in your preferred syntax until it matches either Fig.~\ref{ea:dictLang}
(Visual), or Figs.~\ref{eclipse:dictLang} \& \ref{eclipse:dictLangMetamodel} (Textual).\footnote{Read Part I, Section 1 for a brief comparison of eMoflon's two
speicification types}

\newpage % ---


% -- Download Cheat Package ---
\item[Option 2: Download] 


\item[$\blacktriangleright$] \hspace{0.3cm} Download the Part V `cheat package' by selecting ``New" on the toolbar, and loading the \texttt{Dictionary} syntax
of your choice into your workspace (Fig.~\ref{eclipse_cheatPackage}).

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{eclipse_loadDictionaryProject}
  \caption{Load a \texttt{Dictionary} project into your workspace}
  \label{eclipse_cheatPackage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.5cm}


% -- Export/Import ---
\item[Option 3: Import]


\item[$\blacktriangleright$] \hspace{0.3cm} Use the same files for \texttt{Dictionary} as completed in Part IV. Export the specification files from the existing
project, then import them into a new one in a fresh workspace. Read Part IV, Section 2 for a detailed review on how to do this in either syntax.

% -- End
\end{description}

We recommend reviewing the dictionary metamodel until you feel comfortable with what you'll be working with. It's important to understand how the classes are
constructed and connected. 

Please note that, despite our efforts to ensure uniformity between each of the options, your workspace may look different than ours
depicted in the screenshots. As long as you have the correct and non-conflicting files however, the steps are identical.

The \texttt{dictionaryLanguage} metamodel is only one of two that we'll be using to specify the TGG transformation. After all, TGGs \emph{always} require
separate source and target metamodels. The second metamodel involved in the transformation will be eMoflon's standard \texttt{MocaTree} language. It basically
combines concepts from a filesystem (folders and files), XML concepts (text-only nodes and attributes), and a general indexed containment
hierarchy.\footnote{This is done with an index attribute, which can be used to demand a certain \emph{order} of nodes in an SDM which are otherwise not
guaranteed by default.} It models a generic directory structure with a \texttt{Folder} able to connect to other \texttt{Folders}, and may contain an unlimited
number of \texttt{File} elements. Its Java code is provided by the Eclipse plugin and automatically added to the build path, so it won't actually appear
anywhere in your workspace for you to inspect.  We'll go into more detail about this later, so let's officially initialize the TGG project that will drive our
Model-to-Text transformation.

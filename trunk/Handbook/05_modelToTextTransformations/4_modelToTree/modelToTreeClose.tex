As always, run TGG main one more time. They should now be nearly identical! If you're worried about some of the nodes being in the wrong order, double click on
them to double check their \texttt{index} properties. If everything has been done correctly every \texttt{entry} should be 2, each \texttt{author} should be 1,
and \texttt{title} should be 0.

on a final note, wasn't it great how easy this part was? If we were to use another transformation set up (such as SDMs), we would have had to create independent
rules for this backwards direction. Instead, TGGs gave us this transform for free!

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Re-open \texttt{ForAllNewAuthor}. Add a NAC below \texttt{library} as depicted in FIG. If we had \emph{just} the library link,
then this rule would fail if the library had \emph{any} authors already set. So intead, we must add the email attribute constraint to match.

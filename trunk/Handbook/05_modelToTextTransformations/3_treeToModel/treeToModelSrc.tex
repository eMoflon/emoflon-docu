\section{Tree-to-model transformation with TGGs}
\genHeader

Our goal in this section is to break down the \texttt{MocaTree} to \texttt{Dictionary} transformation into smaller, modular steps. More specifically, we
want separate rules for transforming a \texttt{Folder} into its appropriate container element (i.e., \texttt{Library} or \texttt{Shelf}), then individual rules
to handle whatever \texttt{File} and \texttt{Node} elements they contain (such as transforming each of the \texttt{.dictionary} files into \texttt{dictionary},
\texttt{author}, and \texttt{entry} elements).

{\bf include graph view comparison (top \& bottom) of what we're going FROM to what we're going TO (images already in the right folder)}

When specifying \emph{any} rule, it's important to keep in mind how flexibile the rule should be. In future \texttt{tree} instances for example, we
can not know exactly how many subfolders \texttt{myLibrary} will contain, whether or not each \texttt{.dictionary} file will have an author node (as
seen in \texttt{unknown.dictionary}), or how many entries each \texttt{dictionary} will contain. 

{\bf Also, this is rather dry, its alot of copying what you see here in the text, so get those tunes blasting}

\section{Tree-to-Text transformation}
\genHeader

We've finally reached the last step, transforming our resulting tree, \texttt{tree\-.xmi\-\_FWD\-.xmi\-\_BWD\-.xmi}, into a filesystem with \texttt{.dictionary}
files identical to our original input, the \texttt{myLibrary} filesystem. One of the coolest things about ANTLR is that the same parsing technology that we used
in Section 2 can be used to \emph{unparse} a tree.

Analogously to parsing text with a lexer and parser grammar to produce a tree, a tree is unparsed to text using a \emph{tree grammar} and \emph{templates}. A
tree grammar is similar to EBNF, consisting of a set of rules (\texttt{main}, \texttt{entry}) that match a tree fragment and evaluate a template, as
opposed to a set of rules that match text fragment and build a tree. For further details concerning tree grammars, we refer to \cite{ANTLR} and the ANTLR
website, \url{www.antlr.org}.

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Expand ``src/org.moflon.moca.dictionary.unparser'' and open \texttt{Dict\-ion\-ary\-Tree\-Gram\-mar.g} and edit the contents as
depicted in Fig.~\ref{eclipse:treeGrammar}.

\end{figure}

\newpage


\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Next, open \texttt{Dict\-ion\-ary\-Un\-pars\-er\-Ad\-ap\-ter.java} (Fig~\ref{eclipse:unparserCommented}). You'll notice that this
file contains a (commented) \texttt{StringTemplateGroup} method for retrieving a group of templates and needs to be implemented. The comments explain how to use
either a folder containing different template files, or a single file containing all templates. The latter is better for numerous small templates, while the
former makes sense when the template contains a lot of static text.

  \label{eclipse:unparserCommented}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\item[$\blacktriangleright$] For this small example, a single file with all templates is ideal. Uncomment line 44 (the option for a group file) and remove
the \texttt{Un\-sup\-port\-ed\-Op\-er\-at\-ion\-Ex\-cep\-tion} command.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Create this template file by navigating to the empty ``templates'' folder of your adapter project, and create a new file
called \texttt{Dictionary.stg} (as demanded in \texttt{Dict\-ion\-ary\-Un\-pars\-er\-Ad\-ap\-ter.java}). Complete it as specified in
Fig.~\ref{eclipse:dictionaryTemplate}.

  \label{eclipse:dictionaryTemplate}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Remember how you removed the unparsing command from \texttt{TGGMain.java} at the start of this part? Return to the file and
uncomment line 46.  As you can see, it will create and place the results of this action into a single \texttt{out} folder in the instance directory. 

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Save and run your transformation again. Inspect and compare your input and output files (Fig.~\ref{eclipse:unparseResult}). Are
they the same?

  \label{eclipse:unparseResult}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] If everything succeeded, your transformation is now complete in both directions! Feel free to play around with
changing some files such as a the unparser template, or content of the original files. How are the changes propagated through the transformation?

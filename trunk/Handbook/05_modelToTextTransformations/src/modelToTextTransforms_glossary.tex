\item[Bidirectional Model Transformation]  Consists of two unidirectional model transformations, which are consistent to each other. This requirement of
consistency can be defined in many ways, including using a TGG.

\item[EBNF] Extended Backus-Naur Form; Concrete syntax for specifying context-free string grammars, used to describe the context-free syntax of a
string language.

\item[Endogenous] Transformations between models in the same language (i.e., same input/output metamodel). 
 
\item[Exogenous] Transformations between models in different languages (i.e., different input/output metamodels). 

\item[In-place Transformation] Performs destructive changes directly to the input model, thus transforming it into the output model. Typically
\emph{endogenous}.

\item[Out-place Transformation] Source model is left intact by the transformation that creates the output model. Can be \emph{endogenous} or \emph{exogenous}.

\item[Unidirectional Model Transformation] Takes an input model and produces the an output model.

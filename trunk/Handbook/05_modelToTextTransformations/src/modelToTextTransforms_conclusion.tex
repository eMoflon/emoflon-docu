Dual congratulations are required here. First, great work on completing your first unidirectional Model To text transformation with TGGs! While it first seemed
to be alot of work, this process proved to be simple by providing the backwards transformation for free.

Second, if you've really worked through \emph{every} part of this handbook, upgrade from the coffee and get yourself a nice cold beer -- you've earned it! It's
been a long journey, but you can now consider yourself to be a proper eMoflon master.

The only part remaining in this handbook is Part VI: Miscellaneous, full of reference documentation and one or two small features that we just weren't able to
include with the example. You might find these tips and tricks helpful when embarking on your own tooling project in eMoflon.

I suppose now we must say our sad goodbyes. We hope you enjoyed the example and handbook as much as we have enjoyed creating eMolfon. Our tool is constantly
evolving, so don't forget to check for updates and new information at \texttt{\url{www.emoflon.org}}. Finally, if you have any suggestions, questions, feeback
or corrections (especially with those screenshots -- they get outdated so quickly!), you can reach us anytime at
\texttt{\href{mailto:contact@moflon.org}{contact@moflon.org}}.

Cheers!

Dual congratulations are required here. First, great work on completing your first \emph{unidirectional} Model-To-Text transformation with TGGs! While TGGs
may have seemed to be a lot of work at first, the process proved to be simple as it provided the backwards transformation for free.

Second, if you've really worked through \emph{every} part of this handbook, upgrade from the coffee and get yourself a nice cold beer -- you've earned it! It
has been a long journey, but you can now consider yourself to be a proper eMoflon master.

The only part remaining in this handbook is Part VI: Miscellaneous, full of reference documentation and one or two small features that we just weren't able to
include with the example. You'll also find tips and tricks which may prove helpful when embarking on your own tooling project with eMoflon.

I suppose now we must say our sad goodbyes. We hope you enjoyed the example and handbook as much as we have enjoyed developing eMoflon (and this handbook). Our
tool is constantly evolving, so don't forget to check for updates and new information at \texttt{\url{www.emoflon.org}}. Finally, if you have any suggestions,
questions, feedback or corrections (especially about those screenshots -- they get outdated so quickly!), you can reach us anytime at
\texttt{\href{mailto:contact@moflon.org}{contact@moflon.org}}.

Cheers!

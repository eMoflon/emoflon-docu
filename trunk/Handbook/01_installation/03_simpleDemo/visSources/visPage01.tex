\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Did you notice the new Demo.eap file in your package explorer? This is the EA file you'll be testing and modelling your program with. Don't worry about the other folder and the exclamation mark it carries. The problems will be resolved by the end of this page.

In the meantime, Please do not rename, move, or delete anything.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Double click ``Demo.eap'' to start EA, and choose ``Ultimate" when starting EA for the first time.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] In EA, choose ``Extensions/MOFLON::Ecore Addin/Export\- all\- to\- Workspace'' (Fig.~\ref{fig_ea}).

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Now try exploring the project browser! Try to navigate and understand some of the files and diagrams. This simple demo is meant to familiarize you with visual representations classes, functions, and how they relate to eMoflon's generated code. Don't worry if you get confused - we provide plenty of help and references throughout the handbook.
  
\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Switch back to Eclipse, choose your Metamodel project, and press F5 to refresh. A new folder should appear, and your errors should disappear after a few seconds. Since you've chosen to use the Visual Syntax, there isn't much to look at here. The export from EA places all required files in a hidden folder in the project, and refreshing triggers a build process that invokes our code generators automatically. 
You should be able to monitor the progress with the green bar in the lower right corner. Pressing the symbol opens a monitor view that gives more details of the build process. You don't need to worry about any of these details, just remember to refresh your Eclipse workspace after an export.

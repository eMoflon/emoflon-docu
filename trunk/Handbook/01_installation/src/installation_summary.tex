% Edit me once section is done!
Describe the purpose of this section here; borrow same/similar block of text from the Part 0 ?
(Provide the framework for what's gonna happen)

This part provides a very simple example and a few JUnit tests to test the installation and configuration of eMoflon.

After working through this chapter, you should have an installed and tested eMoflon working for a trivial example.
We also explain the general workflow and the different workspaces involved.

This chapter can be considered \emph{mandatory} if you are new to eMoflon and we recommend working through it in any case.
It's also kept as minimal as possible and should only take a few minutes really.

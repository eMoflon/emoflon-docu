% Edit me again section is done!
\emph{Describe the purpose of this section here; (Provide the framework for what will happen)}

This part provides a very simple example and a few JUnit tests to test the installation and configuration of eMoflon.

After working through this chapter, you should have an installed and tested eMoflon working for a trivial example.
We also explain the general workflow and the different workspaces involved.

This chapter can be considered \emph{mandatory} if you are new to eMoflon, but we reccommend working through it anyway.

Don't forget the way we've presented this tutorial! We introduce the red, blue, and black headers here to separate the visual, textual, and common instructions. 
If what you're doing isn't matching what it says to do next, you might be looking in the wrong place.

If, however, you're finding that the screenshots we've taken aren't matching your screen and you ARE in the right place, please send us an email at \href{mailto:contact@moflon.org}{contact@moflon.org} and let us know. Just like my parents, they get outdated so fast! Feel free to also contact us if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions on ways we can improve.

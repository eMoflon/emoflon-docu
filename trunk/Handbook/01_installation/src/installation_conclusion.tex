Congratulations!\hypertarget{conclusion}{} You've finished Part I! If you feel a bit lost at the moment, please be patient. This first handbook has been a lot
about installation and tool support, and only aims to give a very brief glimpse at the big picture of what is actually going on.

If you enjoyed this section and wish to get started on the key features of eMoflon, Check out Part II! There we will work through a hands-on, step-by-step
example and cover the features of eMoflon.

We shall also introduce clear and simple definitions for the most important metamodelling and graph transformation concepts, always referring to the concrete
example and providing references for further reading.

If you're already familiar with the tool, feel free to pick and choose individual handbooks that are interesting to you. Check out Story Driven Modeling (SDMs)
in Part III, or Triple Graph Transformations (TGGs) in Part IV. We'll provide instructions on how to easily download all the required resources so you can jump
right in. For details on each part, refer to Part 0.

Cheers!

\section{Conclusion and Next Steps}
\vspace{0.5cm}

Congratulations!\hypertarget{conclusion}{} You finished Part I! If you feel a bit lost at the moment, be patient! This first handbook has been a lot about installation and tool support, and only aims at giving a very brief glimpse at the big picture of what is actually going on.  

If you enjoyed this section and wish to get started on the key features of eMoflon, Check out Part II! There we will go through a hands-on, step-by-step example and cover the features of Ecore.

We shall also introduce clear and simple definitions for the most important metamodelling and graph transformation concepts, always referring to the concrete example and providing references for further reading.

If you're already familiar with the tool, feel free to pick and choose chapters that are interesting to you. Check out Story Driven Modeling (SDMs) in Part III, or Triple Graph Transformations (TGGs) in Part IV. For more details on each part, refer to Part 0.

Cheers!

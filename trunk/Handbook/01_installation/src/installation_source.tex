{\bf \Huge Installation and Setup }

\vspace{0.5cm}

This part provides a very simple example and a JUnit test to check the installation and configuration of eMoflon. It can be considered \emph{mandatory} if you
are new to eMoflon, but we recommend working through it anyway.

After working through this part, you should have an installed and tested eMoflon working for a trivial example. We also explain the general workflow, the
different workspaces involved, and general usage of both our visual and textual syntax.

{\bf \Large 3 \hspace{0.5cm}Validating Your Metamodel}

\subsection{ The MOSL Builder (Textual)}

\hypertarget{validation tex}{} Our MOSL language is accompanied with its own builder that proves support for validating the static semantics of your metamodel.
Integrated with the Eclipse IDE, if there's an error in your files when you save, a message will appear in the console. Lets try to make an error, just to
confirm it works.

Go to your \texttt{Partition} class and change the parameter type from \texttt{Card} to \texttt{card}. Press save. An error should immediately appear to inform
you of your terrible mistake. Change your file back to the way it was, and the message should disappear.

Now, what would happen if you were to delete a reference? Can we make a more serious error appear? Go to any class, delete any reference, and press save.
Nothing happens! As we mentioned earlier in the handbook, MOSL updates both classes and objects involved in any association. You won't ever have a 'hanging'
link, or an issue where a link is defined in one place, but not another.

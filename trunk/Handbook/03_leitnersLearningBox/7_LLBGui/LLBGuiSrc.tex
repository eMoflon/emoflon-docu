This is the model, the graph that conforms to the metamodel you just defined!

We would like to now introduce you to the \texttt{Leitner Box Gui}, a small java application generated from your code! Within it, you'll be able to view the
unique instances you created in section 3. Later, this application will also include the implmentations of each method. Navigate to the top left of your toolbar
and select ``New.''

Load ``Examples/eMoflon Handbook Examples/Leitner Box GUI.'' This will load a new project into your workspace. Right click it to bring up the context menu and
select ``Run as/Java application.'' Direct the program to open the \texttt{Box.xmi} file you saved in your workspace \texttt{instances} folder, then view your
work! Keep experimenting in .ecore editor by adding, removing, or renaming more attributes, and observe how they're reflected in the GUI.

\section{Abstract syntax and static semantics}
\label{sec: staticSemantics}

The first step in creating any metamodel is defining the type graph, or abstract syntax. First we'll show you how to begin any new project using either one of
eMoflon's syntaxes. We'll also review the metamodel structure, and how it will also later define the constraints and dynamic semantics. Next, we'll create the
key elements of our type graph, the classes, attributes, and references (types and relations). Finally, while we're here, we'll establish some method signatures
which will eventually lead to our metamodel's dynamic semantics.

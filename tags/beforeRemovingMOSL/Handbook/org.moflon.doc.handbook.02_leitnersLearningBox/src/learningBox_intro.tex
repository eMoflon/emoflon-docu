The toughest part of learning a new language  is often building up a sufficient vocabulary. This is usually accomplished by repeating a long list of words again
and again until they stick. A \emph{Leitner's learning box}\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system}} is a simple but ingenious little
contraption to support this tedious process of memorization.

As depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:membox_illustration}, it consists of a series of compartments or partitions usually of increasing size. The content to be memorized
is written on a series of cards  which are initially placed in the first partition. All cards in the first  partition should be repeated everyday and cards that
have been successfully memorized are placed in the next partition. Cards in all other partitions are only repeated when the corresponding partition is full and
cards that are answered correctly are moved one partition forward in the box. Challenging cards that have been forgotten are treated as brand new cards and
are always returned to the first partition, regardless of how far in the box they have progressed.

These ``rules'' are depicted by the green and red arrows in Fig.~\ref{fig:membox_illustration}. The basic idea is to repeat difficult cards as often as
necessary and not waste time on easy cards which are only repeated now and then to keep them in memory. The increasing size of the partitions represent how
words are easily placed in our limited short term memory and slowly move in our theoretically unlimited long term memory if practised often enough.

A learning box is an interesting system, because it consists clearly of a static structure (the box, partitions with varying sizes, and cards with two sides
of content) and a set of rules that describe the dynamic aspects (behaviour) of the system. In this Part II of the eMoflon handbook,
we shall build a complete learning box from scratch in a model-driven fashion and use it to introduce fundamental concepts in metamodelling and \emph{Model-Driven Software 
Development} (MDSD) in general. We'll begin with a short discussion, then develop the box's abstract syntax, learn about eMoflon's validation, create
some dynamic instances of the box, use injections to integrate a hand-written implementation of a method with generated code from the model, and get to know a
small GUI that will allow us to take the implemented learning box for a spin.

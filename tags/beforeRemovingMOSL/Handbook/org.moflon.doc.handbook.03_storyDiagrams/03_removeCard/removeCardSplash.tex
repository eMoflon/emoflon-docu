\section{Removing a card}
\hypertarget{sec:remCard}{}

Since we're just getting started with SDMs,\footnote{As you may have already noticed, we use ``SDM'' or ``Story Diagrams" interchangeably to mean both our graph
transformation language \emph{or} a concrete transformation used to implement a method, consisting of an activity with activity nodes containing story
patterns.} let's re-implement the method previously specified directly in Java as an injection.\footnote{Refer to Part II, Section 6} The goal of this method
is to remove a single card from its current partition, which can be done by destroying the link between the two items (Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_removeCard}).

According to the signature of the method \texttt{removeCard}, we should return the card that has been deleted. Although this might strike you as slightly odd,
considering that we already passed in the card as an argument, it still makes sense as it allows for chaining method calls:
\syntax{ aPartition.removeCard(aCard).invert()}

Before we implement this change as a story diagram, let's remove the old injection content to avoid potential conflicts.

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Delete the \texttt{PartitionImpl.inject} file from your working set (Fig~\ref{eclipse:delete_injection}).

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Now select \texttt{LearningBoxLanguage} and click on the ``Build" button. 

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] You'll be able to see the changes in \texttt{PartitionImpl.java}. The \texttt{removeCard}
declaration should now be empty and look identical to the other unimplemented methods.

\end{itemize}

That's it! We now have a fresh start for \texttt{removeCard}. Let's briefly discuss what we need to establish the transformation.

One of the goals of SDM is to allow you to focus less on \emph{how} a method will do something, but rather on \emph{what} the method will do.
Integrated as an atomic step in the overall control flow, a single graph transformation step (such as link deletion) can be embedded as a
\emph{story pattern}.

These patterns declare \emph{object variables}\define{Object \\ Variable}, place holders for actual objects in a model. During \emph{pattern matching}, objects
in the current model are assigned to the object variables in the pattern according to the indicated type and other conditions.\footnote{We shall learn what
further conditions may be specified in later SDMs.}

\clearpage

In \texttt{removeCard}, the SDM requires just two object variables: a \texttt{this} partition (named according to Java convention) referring to the
object whose method is invoked, and \texttt{card}, the parameter that will be removed.

Patterns also declare \emph{link variables}\define{Link \\ Variable} to match references in the model. Given that
we're concerned with removing a certain card from a specific partition, \texttt{removeCard} will therefore have a single link variable that connects these two
objects together.

In general, pattern matching is non-deterministic, i.e., variables in the pattern are bound to \emph{any} objects that happen to match. How can this
be influenced so that, as required for \texttt{removeCard}, the pattern matcher chooses the correct \texttt{card} (that which is passed in as a parameter)?

The \emph{binding state}\define{Binding~State} of an object variable determines how it is found. By default, every object variable is \emph{unbound}, or a 
\emph{free variable}\define{Free \\ Variable}. Values for these variables can be determined automatically by the pattern matcher. By declaring an
object variable that is to be \emph{bound}\define{Bound} however, it will have a fixed value determined from previous activity nodes. The appropriate binding is
implicitly determined via the \emph{name} of the bound object variable. As a rule, \texttt{this} variables, and any method parameters (i.e., \texttt{card}) are
always bound.

On a final note, every object or link variable can also set its \emph{binding operator} to \texttt{Check Only, Create, or Destroy}. For a rule $r: (L,
R)$, as discussed in \hyperlink{explanation}{Section 2}, this marks the variable as belonging to the set of elements to be retained ($L\cap R$), the set of
elements to be newly created ($R\setminus L$), or the set of elements to be deleted ($L\setminus R$).

If you're feeling overwhelmed by all the new terms and concepts, don't worry! We will define them again in the context of your chosen syntax with the
concrete example. For quick reference, we have also defined the most important terms at the end of this part in a \hyperlink{glossary}{glossary}.

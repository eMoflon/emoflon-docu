\section{Creating and Using Enumerations in Enterprise Architect}
\genHeader

This section describes how to create enumeration types in your metamodel.
For illustration purposes, we use the linked-list demonstration project from
Part I.

Suppose we want to assign one of several predefined colors (e.g., red, green,
blue) to each \texttt{Node} in a \texttt{List}.
To represent the colors, we create an enumeration called \texttt{Color} with
three elements: \texttt{Color.RED}, \texttt{Color.GREEN} and
\texttt{Color.BLUE}.
